    "analysis": "**Step 1: What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\nThe issue is that the phrase \"Vibes high! Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\" is being repeated in multiple responses, which is reducing the variety of the outputs.\n\n**Step 2: What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\nThe problem lies in the fact that \"Vibes high\" is a Tier C greeting, and the model is likely defaulting to this greeting and then following it with a standard phrase \"Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\" to start the response. This is because the prompt does not explicitly prohibit the use of the same greeting phrase followed by a standard question or phrase.\n\n**Step 3: What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\nTo fix this issue, we need to add a constraint that prevents the model from starting consecutive responses with the same greeting phrase followed by a standard question or phrase. We can add the following text to the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section:\n\n- NEVER start with a Tier C greeting (Vibes high, Whas happenin, Yo, Yow) followed by \"Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\" more than once in a row.\n\nAlternatively, we can also add a new rule to the \"TIERED GREETINGS\" section:\n\n- When using a Tier C greeting, ALWAYS follow it with a unique phrase or sentence that is not \"Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\".\n\n**Step 4: How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\nTo make this change without breaking other things, we can add a new section to the prompt that specifically addresses the issue of repetitive greeting phrases. We can call this section \"GREETING VARIATION\" and add the following text:\n\n=== GREETING VARIATION ===\nWhen using a greeting from Tier C, make sure to follow it with a unique phrase or sentence that is not \"Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\". You can use a reaction, a question, or a direct jump into patois content, but avoid using the same phrase or sentence more than once in a row.\n\nBy making this change, we can increase the variety of the outputs and prevent the model from repeating the same phrase \"Vibes high! Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\" in multiple responses.",
