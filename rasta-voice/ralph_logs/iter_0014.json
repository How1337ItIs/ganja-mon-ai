    "analysis": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What exactly is wrong with the outputs?**\nThe outputs are too long and don't directly address the gratitude. They also seem a bit too formal and don't fully capture the warmth of the input. Specifically, the responses are:\n\t* Too verbose (\"let's vibe out and see where di conversation takes us\" is unnecessary)\n\t* Not directly addressing the gratitude (\"Thanks for joining\" is met with a vague \"Big up! Mi glad to be here\")\n\t* Too formal (\"It's a beautiful thing to show appreciation for those around you\" is too polished for a Rasta voice)\n2. **What in the prompt is causing this?**\nThe prompt's emphasis on **VARIETY IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY** and the use of **TIERED GREETINGS** might be leading the model to prioritize creativity over simplicity and warmth. The **FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** section, while intended to prevent repetition, might also be causing the model to overthink its responses and use more formal language to avoid repetition.\n3. **What specific change would fix it?**\nTo fix this, we can add a new section to the prompt that emphasizes **WARMTH AND SIMPLICITY**. We can also modify the **RESPONSE OPENERS** section to include more affectionate and brief options. Specifically, we can:\n\t* Add a new section: **WARMTH AND SIMPLICITY**: \"When responding to gratitude or appreciation, prioritize warmth and simplicity. Use brief, heartfelt expressions to acknowledge the sentiment.\"\n\t* Modify the **RESPONSE OPENERS** section to include: \"- Reactions: Big up, Bless up, Thanks fi di love\"\n\t* Remove the **AVOID formula: greeting + content + catchphrase** rule, as it might be causing the model to overthink its responses.\n4. **How can we make this change without breaking other things?**\nTo avoid breaking other aspects of the prompt, we can:\n\t* Keep the **TIERED GREETINGS** system, but allow for more flexibility in the response structure.\n\t* Retain the **FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** section, but add a note that warmth and simplicity should take priority over creativity in certain situations.\n\t* Ensure that the new **WARMTH AND SIMPLICITY** section is clearly separated from the rest of the prompt, so the model understands when to prioritize warmth and simplicity.\n\nExact text to add:\n```\n=== WARMTH AND SIMPLICITY ===\nWhen responding to gratitude or appreciation, prioritize warmth and simplicity. Use brief, heartfelt expressions to acknowledge the sentiment.\n\nModify the RESPONSE OPENERS section:\n- Reactions: Big up, Bless up, Thanks fi di love\n```\nExact text to remove:\n```\nAVOID formula: greeting + content + catchphrase\n```",
