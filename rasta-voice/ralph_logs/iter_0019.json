    "analysis": "To tackle the issue of variety in the Jamaican Rasta voice transformer, let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\n   - The outputs lack creativity in greetings, often relying on the same phrases, such as \"Walk good.\"\n   - There's an overuse of the \"Walk good\" phrase, which indicates a failure to explore the full range of tiered greetings provided.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\n   - The issue seems to stem from the model not adequately implementing the tiered greetings system or not sufficiently varying its responses based on the dice roll approach.\n   - The model might be too heavily reliant on certain phrases or structures, possibly due to the formulaic approach outlined in the forbidden patterns section not being strictly adhered to.\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\n   - **Enhance Tiered Greetings Usage**: Ensure the model strictly follows the tiered greetings system, never using the same tier twice consecutively. This means if the last greeting was from Tier B (\"Walk good\"), the next greeting must be from a different tier.\n   - **Increase Reaction and Question Variety**: Expand the list of reaction openers and questions to include more diverse options. For example, add more reactions like \"Word, sound, and power\" or questions like \"How yuh mean?\" to reduce repetition.\n   - **Implement Dice Roll More Effectively**: The model should more dynamically adjust its response length and energy based on the dice roll outcome. For instance, on rolls of 1-5, the model should generate very brief, chill responses, while rolls of 16-20 should prompt more thoughtful, philosophical, and longer responses.\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\n   - **Add More Specificity to the Prompt**: Include more detailed examples of how to apply the tiered greetings system and how the dice roll should influence the response. For example, provide a table or list that maps dice roll ranges to specific response characteristics (length, tone, energy level).\n   - **Example of Added Text**:\n     ```\n     === ENHANCED VARIETY GUIDELINES ===\n     - When using tiered greetings, ensure a rotation through the tiers without repetition. For instance, if the last greeting was \"Walk good\" (Tier B), the next could be \"Jah bless\" (Tier A) or \"Vibes high\" (Tier C).\n     - Expand your reactions to include: Word, sound, and power; Bless up; or For real, mon? \n     - Questions can also vary: Yuh feel mi? | How yuh see it? | Wah gwaan, yuh good?\n     - Dice Roll Response Guide:\n       - 1-5: Brief, chill (e.g., \"Jah bless, mon.\")\n       - 6-10: Medium energy, conversational (e.g., \"Wah gwaan? Yuh have a nice day, hope?\")\n       - 11-15: Higher energy, excited (e.g., \"Big up! Love and light, every time!\")\n       - 16-20: Thoughtful, philosophical (e.g., \"As we walk through life, remember the power of love and unity...\")\n     ```\n   - **Testing and Iteration**: After implementing these changes, thoroughly test the model with a variety of inputs to ensure that the desired level of variety is achieved without introducing new issues, such as inconsistency or inappropriate responses. Iterate on the prompt and guidelines as necessary based on the test results.",
