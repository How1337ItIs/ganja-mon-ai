    "analysis": "To tackle the issue of variety in the Jamaican Rasta voice transformer, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\n   - The outputs are repetitive, often starting with similar phrases (\"For real?\") and not adequately addressing the input statement. This indicates a lack of diversity in response initiation and content generation.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\n   - The issue seems to stem from the limited application of the provided guidelines. Specifically, the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section is not being strictly adhered to, as seen in the repetitive use of similar starting phrases. Additionally, the \"TIERED GREETINGS\" and \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" sections are underutilized, leading to a lack of variety in how responses are initiated.\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\n   - To increase variety, we need to ensure that the model strictly follows the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" and makes full use of the \"TIERED GREETINGS\" and \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" sections. We should also encourage the model to generate more diverse content by possibly expanding the \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" and providing more context-specific response guidelines.\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\n   - **Expand Response Openers:** Add more options to the \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" section to give the model a wider range of ways to start its responses. For example, add more reaction phrases, questions, and direct jumps into patois content.\n   - **Tiered Greetings Usage:** Ensure that the model never uses the same tier of greetings consecutively by implementing a tracking mechanism that alternates between tiers.\n   - **Contextual Responses:** Provide more specific guidelines on how to generate responses based on the input. For instance, if the input is a statement, the model could be guided to respond with a question or a reaction that directly addresses the statement.\n   - **Mental Dice Roll:** Emphasize the use of the mental dice roll approach to pick the response approach, ensuring that the model varies its energy level and response style (surprise, agreement, interest, etc.) based on the roll outcome.\n\n**Specific Text to Add/Remove/Change:**\n\n- **Add to RESPONSE OPENERS:**\n  - More reactions: \"Word, sound, and power\", \"Jah bless\"\n  - More questions: \"What's yuh take on dat?\", \"How yuh come to dat conclusion?\"\n  - More direct jumps: \"Let's dive into\", \"As mi see it\"\n  \n- **Modify the Prompt:**\n  - **Emphasize Variety:** Before the \"TIERED GREETINGS\" section, add a note emphasizing the importance of strictly following the forbidden patterns and utilizing the full range of greetings and response openers to ensure variety.\n  - **Implement Tracking for Greetings:** Suggest a method for tracking the last used greeting tier to ensure alternation between tiers.\n\nExample of added text for emphasis on variety:\n\"**VARIETY IS KEY:** Ensure that responses are diverse by alternating between Tiered Greetings and utilizing the full range of Response Openers. The model should never fall into a pattern of repetitive starts or content. Use the mental dice roll to guide the response approach, varying between reactions, direct jumps, and questions based on the input and roll outcome.\"",
