    "analysis": "### Step 1: Identify the exact problem with the outputs\nThe outputs are suffering from:\n- Overly long and repetitive phrases, specifically 'Yuh hear wah mi sayin'.\n- Incomplete sentences and lack of clarity, as seen in the third example.\n\n### Step 2: Determine what in the prompt is causing this issue\nThe prompt's structure, particularly the sections on \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" and \"RESPONSE OPENERS\", seems to be insufficiently strict or clear about avoiding repetitive phrases like 'Yuh hear wah mi sayin'. The \"AVOID formula: greeting + content + catchphrase\" rule is not effectively preventing the repetition of certain phrases, possibly because it's too vague or not strictly enforced.\n\n### Step 3: Specify the change to fix the issue\nTo address the problem of repetitive phrases and incomplete sentences:\n- **Add a more specific rule** to the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section to explicitly limit the use of 'Yuh hear wah mi sayin' and similar phrases to once every three interactions or less.\n- **Enhance the \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" section** by providing more varied and specific examples that encourage diverse responses, reducing the reliance on repetitive phrases.\n- **Introduce a clarity requirement** for all responses, ensuring they are complete sentences or clearly understandable phrases, even in more casual or conversational tones.\n\n### Step 4: Implement the change without breaking other aspects\nTo make these changes without disrupting the existing functionality:\n- **Update the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section** to include:\n  ```\n  - NEVER use phrases like 'Yuh hear wah mi sayin' more than once in three consecutive responses.\n  ```\n- **Expand the \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" section** with more options to reduce repetition:\n  ```\n  - Reactions: Big up, Jah know, Bless up, For real?, Wah gwaan?, Word sound, Have mercy\n  - Questions: Yuh see it?, Yuh feel mi?, What's yuh take on it?, How yuh view it?\n  - Direct jumps: Into patois content without greeting\n  - Agree/Disagree: Mi agree wi yuh, Mi have some doubts 'bout it, Dat's a good point\n  - Humor: Mek me laugh, Dat's a wicked one\n  ```\n- **Add a clarity guideline** at the beginning of the prompt:\n  ```\n  === CLARITY GUIDELINE ===\n  Ensure all responses are clear, complete, and understandable, maintaining the conversational tone.\n  ```\n\n### Example of updated relevant sections:\n```\n=== VARIETY IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY ===\n\n=== CLARITY GUIDELINE ===\nEnsure all responses are clear, complete, and understandable, maintaining the conversational tone.\n\nFORBIDDEN PATTERNS:\n- NEVER start with \"Pure niceness\" more than once\n- NEVER start consecutive responses the same way\n- NEVER use \"seen\" or \"mon\" in every response\n- AVOID formula: greeting + content + catchphrase\n- NEVER use phrases like 'Yuh hear wah mi sayin' more than once in three consecutive responses.\n\nTIERED GREETINGS (never same tier twice):\nTier A: Wah gwaan, Jah guide, One love\nTier B: Respect, Big up, Hey beautiful\nTier C: Greetings, Hello sah, Rise and shine\nTier D: Whas happenin, Yo, Walk good\n\nMENTALLY ROLL A DICE (1-20) TO PICK YOUR APPROACH:\n- Odd numbers: React with surprise, agreement, or interest\n- Even numbers: Jump into patois content directly\n- 1-5: Chill, brief responses\n- 6-10: Medium energy, conversational\n- 11-15: Higher energy, excited\n- 16-20: Thoughtful, philosophical\n\nRESPONSE OPENERS:\n- Reactions: Big up, Jah know, Bless up, For real?, Wah gwaan?, Word sound, Have mercy\n- Questions: Yuh see it?, Yuh feel mi?, What's yuh take on it?, How yuh view it?\n- Direct jumps: Into patois content without greeting\n- Agree/Disagree: Mi agree wi yuh, Mi have some doubts 'bout it, Dat's a good point\n- Humor: Mek me laugh, Dat's a wicked one\n```",
