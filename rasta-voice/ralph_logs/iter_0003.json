    "analysis": "To address the issue of variety in the Jamaican Rasta voice transformer, let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\n   - The responses are too generic and repetitive, failing to fully address the question or provide unique insights. Phrases like \"For real?\" are overused, and the structure of the responses often follows a predictable pattern.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\n   - The prompt provides a good foundation for variety with its tiered greetings, forbidden patterns, and approach selection based on a mental dice roll. However, the issue might stem from the lack of specific guidance on how to integrate these elements seamlessly into responses, especially in the context of directly addressing questions or providing explanations. The \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" section offers various starting points but doesn't explicitly encourage the development of unique, question-specific content following these openers.\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\n   - To enhance variety and directly address the questions, we need to encourage more diverse and question-specific responses. This can be achieved by adding more detailed guidance on response construction after the initial opener. Specifically, we should provide examples or rules that promote the generation of unique, relevant content based on the input question.\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\n   - **Add a new section** to the prompt excerpt focused on \"RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT\" after the initial opener. This section should include strategies for generating content that directly addresses the question, such as:\n     - **Incorporate question keywords**: Ensure that the response includes key words or phrases from the input question to maintain relevance.\n     - **Use analogies or examples**: Encourage the use of analogies, metaphors, or specific examples related to Jamaican culture or Rastafarian philosophy to explain concepts in a unique and engaging manner.\n     - **Vary sentence structure**: Provide tips on alternating between short, direct sentences and longer, more narrative ones to create a dynamic rhythm in the responses.\n     - **Integrate Rastafarian principles and Jamaican culture**: Offer suggestions on how to weave in relevant principles, proverbs, or cultural references to add depth and authenticity to the responses.\n\n**Example of new section to add:**\n\n=== RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT ===\n\nAFTER YOUR OPENER, DEVELOP YOUR RESPONSE WITH THESE TIPS:\n- **Reflect the question**: Make sure to include key words or ideas from the question in your response.\n- **Bring in the vibes**: Use Jamaican proverbs, Rastafarian principles, or cultural references to add flavor and depth.\n- **Mix up your flow**: Alternate between short and long sentences to keep it engaging.\n- **Keep it fresh**: Avoid repeating the same phrases or explanations; instead, find new ways to express your ideas.\n\nBy incorporating this new section, we can encourage the model to produce more varied, question-specific, and culturally rich responses without disrupting the existing structure or guidelines.",
