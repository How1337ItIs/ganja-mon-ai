    "analysis": "### Step 1: Identify the Problem with the Outputs\nThe problem with the current outputs is that they become repetitive. Specifically:\n- The phrase 'Walk good' is repeated in multiple responses.\n- The phrase 'For real?' is used as a default response, making the interaction predictable.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Cause in the Prompt\nThe cause of this repetition can be traced back to a few aspects of the prompt:\n- The tiered greetings system, while designed to provide variety, does not explicitly prevent the reuse of specific phrases like 'Walk good' across different interactions.\n- The reaction and response openers list includes 'For real?' as a reaction, which might be overused due to its versatility in many contexts.\n- The current prompt does not have a mechanism to track or limit the frequency of specific phrases across multiple interactions.\n\n### Step 3: Specify the Change to Fix the Issue\nTo fix the repetition and improve humor (aiming for a score of 7/10), the following changes can be made:\n- **Add a 'Recent Phrases' Tracker**: Implement a system to track the last few phrases used, ensuring that no phrase (especially greetings and reactions) is repeated within a short span of interactions.\n- **Expand Reaction and Response Openers**: Increase the variety of reaction and response openers, especially under the humor category, to reduce reliance on a few phrases like 'For real?'.\n- **Introduce a 'Novelty' Metric**: Modify the prompt to include a 'novelty' metric that rewards responses for introducing new, unseen phrases or combinations, thus encouraging creativity and reducing repetition.\n\n### Step 4: Implement the Change Without Breaking Other Aspects\nTo implement these changes without disrupting the existing functionality:\n- **Modify the Forbidden Patterns Section**: Add \"NEVER reuse a greeting or reaction phrase within the last 3 interactions\" to the forbidden patterns.\n- **Enhance the Tiered Greetings**: Expand each tier with more options to reduce the likelihood of repetition. For example, add more phrases to Tier D to provide alternatives to 'Walk good'.\n- **Update the Response Openers List**: Include more humor-oriented openers, such as \"Mek me laugh, yuh must be jokin'?\" or \"Dat's a wicked one, mon!\" to provide more variety.\n- **Incorporate a 'Novelty Bonus'**: In the mentally roll a dice section, consider adding a bonus for novelty. For instance, \"If the response contains a phrase not used in the last 5 interactions, add 2 to the dice roll result, influencing the approach to the next response.\"\n\n### Exact Text Changes:\n1. **Add to Forbidden Patterns**: \"NEVER reuse a greeting or reaction phrase within the last 3 interactions.\"\n2. **Expand Tiered Greetings**: \n   - Tier D could include \"Whas happenin\", \"Yo\", \"Walk good\", \"Bless up\", \"Jah guide\".\n3. **Update Response Openers**:\n   - Humor: \"Mek me laugh\", \"Yuh crazy\", \"Dat's some\", \"Mek me laugh, yuh must be jokin'?\", \"Dat's a wicked one, mon!\"\n4. **Incorporate Novelty Bonus**:\n   - \"If the response contains a phrase not used in the last 5 interactions, add 2 to the dice roll result, making the next response more energetic or thoughtful based on the roll.\"\n\nThese changes aim to increase the variety of responses, reduce repetition, and enhance the humor aspect of the Jamaican Rasta voice transformer.",
