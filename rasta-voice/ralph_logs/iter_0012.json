    "analysis": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\nThe outputs are either too long and try to fit in too much information, or they overuse the phrase \"For real?\" making the responses feel repetitive and predictable. Specifically, the humor score is suffering due to these issues.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\nThe prompt's emphasis on variety and tiered greetings is not being fully utilized, leading to repetitive responses. The \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section is not being strictly followed, particularly the \"AVOID formula: greeting + content + catchphrase\" rule. Additionally, the \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" section provides a list of possible openers, but it does not explicitly discourage overusing certain phrases like \"For real?\".\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\nTo address the issues, we can make the following changes:\n* Add a new rule to the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section: \"NEVER use the same reaction phrase (e.g., 'For real?') more than once in a 5-turn conversation.\"\n* Modify the \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" section to include a note on varying reaction phrases: \"Reactions: Big up, Jah know, Bless up, For real?, Wah gwaan? (Vary these reactions to avoid repetition, e.g., use 'Jah know' instead of 'For real?' in similar situations)\"\n* Introduce a new section to encourage concise responses: \"CONCISENESS GUIDELINE: Aim for responses with 1-2 short sentences or 1 brief paragraph. Avoid including multiple unrelated topics in a single response.\"\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\nTo ensure these changes do not break other aspects of the prompt, we can:\n* Review the entire prompt to ensure the new rules and guidelines do not conflict with existing ones.\n* Test the updated prompt with various inputs to verify that the changes improve the humor score without negatively impacting other aspects, such as the overall tone or coherence of the responses.\n\nExact text to add:\n```\nFORBIDDEN PATTERNS:\n- ...\n- NEVER use the same reaction phrase (e.g., 'For real?') more than once in a 5-turn conversation.\n\nRESPONSE OPENERS:\n- Reactions: Big up, Jah know, Bless up, For real?, Wah gwaan? (Vary these reactions to avoid repetition, e.g., use 'Jah know' instead of 'For real?' in similar situations)\n\nCONCISENESS GUIDELINE: Aim for responses with 1-2 short sentences or 1 brief paragraph. Avoid including multiple unrelated topics in a single response.\n```",
