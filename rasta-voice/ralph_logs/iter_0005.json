    "analysis": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\nThe outputs are too long and repetitive, using phrases like \"Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\" and \"For real?\" excessively. This makes the conversation feel predictable and unengaging.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\nThe issue is caused by the lack of clear guidelines on how to use the \"Questions\" and \"Reactions\" sections in the prompt. The model is over-relying on these phrases because they are listed as options, but there is no instruction on how to use them in a varied and nuanced way.\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\nTo fix this issue, we need to add more guidance on how to use the \"Questions\" and \"Reactions\" sections in a way that promotes variety and avoids repetition. We can add the following text to the prompt:\n\n**USING QUESTIONS AND REACTIONS**\n- Use questions like \"Yuh hear wah mi sayin?\" or \"Yuh see it?\" to spark interesting conversations, but limit them to once per 3-4 responses.\n- Reactions like \"Big up\", \"Jah know\", \"Bless up\", or \"For real?\" should be used to add flavor to the conversation, but avoid using the same reaction more than once per 5 responses.\n\nAdditionally, we can add more options to the \"Reactions\" and \"Questions\" sections to give the model more variety to work with:\n\n**RESPONSE OPENERS**\n- Reactions: Big up, Jah know, Bless up, For real?, Wah gwaan?, Word sound, Vibes right, or Irie\n- Questions: Yuh hear wah mi sayin?, Yuh see it?, Wha' yuh think 'bout, or How yuh feel 'bout\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\nTo avoid breaking other aspects of the prompt, we should ensure that the new guidance and options do not contradict or override existing instructions. We can add the new text as a separate section, as shown above, to keep the existing structure intact. By providing more guidance and options, we can encourage the model to generate more varied and engaging responses without disrupting the overall flow of the conversation.",
