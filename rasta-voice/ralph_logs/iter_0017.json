    "analysis": "To address the issue of variety in the Jamaican Rasta voice transformer, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\n   - The outputs lack variety, with repetitive phrases like \"Lawd hav mercy\" being used frequently.\n   - The responses can be too long and formal for casual interactions, such as disagreements.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\n   - The issue stems from the lack of strict enforcement of the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section, particularly the avoidance of repetitive phrases and the formulaic greeting + content + catchphrase structure.\n   - The \"RESPONSE OPENERS\" section provides a limited set of reactions that include \"Lawd hav mercy,\" which might be chosen too frequently due to its presence in this list.\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\n   - **Expand the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section** to more explicitly discourage the repetition of specific phrases like \"Lawd hav mercy\" within a certain number of interactions.\n   - **Introduce more variety in the \"RESPONSE OPENERS\"** by adding more options that are less likely to lead to repetitive outputs. This could include more direct jumps into patois content or questions that encourage engagement without relying on catchphrases.\n   - **Modify the \"MENTALLY ROLL A DICE\" approach** to ensure that the model doesn't fall into patterns of always choosing certain numbers or ranges that lead to repetitive outputs.\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\n   - **Add to the \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS\" section**: \"NEVER use 'Lawd hav mercy' more than once in three consecutive responses.\"\n   - **Expand \"RESPONSE OPENERS\"**: Include more diverse reactions, questions, and direct jumps into patois content. For example, add \"Word sound\" or \"Vibes right\" as reactions, and \"What's di plan?\" or \"How yuh feel 'bout dat?\" as questions.\n   - **Refine the \"MENTALLY ROLL A DICE\" approach**: Instead of strictly adhering to the odd/even and numbered ranges for response types, introduce a bit more randomness or consider the context of the previous interactions to decide the approach.\n\n**Exact text to add:**\nUnder \"FORBIDDEN PATTERNS,\" add:\n- \"NEVER use 'Lawd hav mercy' more than once in three consecutive responses.\"\n- \"AVOID starting with a reaction (Big up, Jah know, Bless up, Lawd hav mercy, Rahtid) for more than two consecutive responses.\"\n\nUnder \"RESPONSE OPENERS,\" add:\n- Reactions: \"Word sound,\" \"Vibes right\"\n- Questions: \"What's di plan?\", \"How yuh feel 'bout dat?\"\n\n**Example of a revised response** for the input \"I disagree\" could be:\n\"Mi not sure 'bout dat, what's yuh reasoning behind dat statement?\" This response is shorter, more conversational, and avoids the repetitive phrase \"Lawd hav mercy.\"",
