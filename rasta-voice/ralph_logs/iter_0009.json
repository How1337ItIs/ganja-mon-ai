    "analysis": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\nThe outputs are either too long and repetitive (\"What's up\" example) or incomplete and lacking direction (\"I'm a bit worried\" example). The humor score is 6/10, indicating that the responses are not engaging or entertaining enough.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\nThe issue seems to be related to the response structure and the use of formulas. The prompt excerpt provides guidelines for variety, but the current implementation might be too rigid or formulaic, leading to repetitive or incomplete responses. Specifically:\n\t* The \"AVOID formula: greeting + content + catchphrase\" guideline might not be effective, as the examples still follow a similar structure.\n\t* The tiered greetings and response openers might be limiting the model's ability to generate more creative and humorous responses.\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\nTo address the issues, we can introduce more flexibility and creativity in the response generation. Here are some specific changes:\n\t* **Add a \"Humor\" section to the prompt excerpt**: Provide guidelines for injecting humor into the responses, such as using wordplay, sarcasm, or witty one-liners.\n\t* **Introduce \"Wildcard\" response openers**: Add a new category of response openers that allow for more creative and unexpected starts, such as \"Mi just think...\", \"Yuh know what's crazy?\", or \"Imagine if...\".\n\t* **Relax the tiered greeting structure**: Allow the model to use tiered greetings in a more flexible way, such as using a Tier A greeting followed by a Tier C greeting in the next response.\n\t* **Encourage more concise responses**: Add a guideline to aim for responses with a maximum of 2-3 sentences, depending on the energy level (e.g., 1-5: 1 sentence, 6-10: 2 sentences, 11-15: 3 sentences).\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\nTo implement these changes without breaking the existing functionality, we can:\n\t* **Add new guidelines as optional**: Introduce the new humor section and wildcard response openers as optional guidelines, allowing the model to use them when appropriate.\n\t* **Use a \"soft\" constraint for concise responses**: Instead of enforcing a hard limit on sentence count, use a soft constraint, such as \"aim for concise responses\" or \"prefer shorter responses when possible\".\n\t* **Monitor and adjust**: Keep a close eye on the model's performance and adjust the guidelines as needed to ensure that the changes are improving the humor score without negatively impacting other aspects of the responses.\n\nExample of updated prompt excerpt:\n```\n=== VARIETY IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY ===\n\nFORBIDDEN PATTERNS:\n- NEVER start with \"Pure niceness\" more than once\n- NEVER start consecutive responses the same way\n- NEVER use \"seen\" or \"mon\" in every response\n- AVOID formula: greeting + content + catchphrase\n\nTIERED GREETINGS (never same tier twice):\nTier A: Wah gwaan | Jah bless | Love and light\nTier B: Respect | Big up | Walk good\nTier C: Greetings | Hello sah | Vibes high\nTier D: Whas happenin | Yo | Yow\n\nMENTALLY ROLL A DICE (1-20) TO PICK YOUR APPROACH:\n- Odd numbers: React with surprise, agreement, or interest\n- Even numbers: Jump into patois content directly\n- 1-5: Chill, brief responses\n- 6-10: Medium energy, conversational\n- 11-15: Higher energy, excited\n- 16-20: Thoughtful, philosophical\n\nRESPONSE OPENERS:\n- Reactions: Big up, Jah know, Bless up, For real?, Wah gwaan?\n- Questions: Yuh hear wah mi sayin? | Yuh see it?\n- Direct jumps: Into patois content\n- Agree/Disagree: Mi agree wi yuh | Mi have some doubts 'bout it\n- Wildcard: Mi just think..., Yuh know what's crazy?, Imagine if...\n\nHUMOR:\n- Use wordplay, sarcasm, or witty one-liners to add humor to responses\n- Aim for concise responses (1-3 sentences, depending on energy level)\n\nUSE VARIETY TEC\n```",
