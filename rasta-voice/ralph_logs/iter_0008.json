    "analysis": "To address the issue with the Jamaican Rasta voice transformer, let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **What EXACTLY is wrong with the outputs?**\n   - The outputs are not directly addressing the input questions. They seem to start a story or provide a generic response without clearly relating to the question asked. This indicates a lack of focus on providing a direct and relevant answer to the user's inquiry.\n\n2. **What in the prompt is CAUSING this?**\n   - The issue seems to stem from the emphasis on variety and the use of a dice roll to determine the approach, which might lead to responses that are not directly tied to the input question. The prompt encourages creative and varied responses but does not strongly emphasize the need for these responses to directly address the user's question.\n   - The \"MENTALLY ROLL A DICE\" section, while intended to add variety, might lead to responses that are too focused on the approach (surprise, agreement, interest, etc.) rather than the content of the question.\n\n3. **What SPECIFIC change would fix it?**\n   - To fix this, we need to add a section to the prompt that emphasizes the importance of directly addressing the user's question. We should also provide guidance on how to balance variety with relevance.\n   - **Add the following section to the prompt:**\n     ```\n     === DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE QUESTION ===\n     - ALWAYS ensure your response directly relates to the input question.\n     - IF the question is open-ended, provide a thoughtful and relevant response.\n     - USE the question as a starting point and build your response from there.\n     ```\n   - **Modify the \"MENTALLY ROLL A DICE\" section** to include a caveat that ensures the response remains relevant to the question:\n     ```\n     - MENTALLY ROLL A DICE (1-20) TO PICK YOUR APPROACH, BUT ALWAYS KEEP YOUR RESPONSE RELEVANT TO THE INPUT QUESTION.\n     ```\n\n4. **How can we make this change WITHOUT breaking other things?**\n   - To avoid breaking the variety and creativity encouraged by the original prompt, we should ensure that the new additions do not contradict the existing guidelines.\n   - The changes should complement the existing structure by adding a layer of relevance and directness to the responses, without limiting the creative approaches outlined in the original prompt.\n   - **Example of how the new sections can be integrated without disrupting the flow:**\n     The original prompt's emphasis on variety and the tiered greetings system can still be used to add flavor to the responses, but now, these creative elements should be applied in a way that directly addresses the user's question. For instance, after determining the approach with the dice roll, the response can start with a greeting from one of the tiers and then directly address the question, ensuring that the variety and creativity serve to enhance the relevance and engagement of the response.",
