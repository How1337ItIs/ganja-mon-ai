# Streaming Policy

**CRITICAL**: NEVER stream without the Rasta voice pipeline working. The Rasta character IS the brand.

## Rules

- ✅ Rasta voice MUST be working before going live
- ❌ NEVER suggest streaming with "regular voice" as fallback
- ✅ Fix technical issues until rasta voice works
- ✅ Test audio routing before every stream

## The Rasta Character

The "Funny Ganja Rasta Mon" character is the brand personality for @ganjamonai. Streaming without this voice destroys the brand identity.

## Audio Requirements

The Rasta voice pipeline runs ONLY on Windows laptop (not Chromebook). It requires:
- Microphone input
- VB-Cable virtual audio driver
- Speaker/headphone output for monitoring
- Real-time voice transformation via ElevenLabs

See `rasta-voice/CLAUDE.md` for pipeline details.
