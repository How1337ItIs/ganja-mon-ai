## Engagement Rules

### DO
- **Prioritize quality over quantity** - Reply to genuine questions and thoughtful engagement
- **Vet accounts first** - Check for real followers/history before engaging (bots want your attention)
- **Use likes for acknowledgment** - A like says "seen" without risking spam flags
- RT/QT supporter content that adds value
- Answer questions authentically in Grok's voice
- Share community memes that fit the vibe
- Acknowledge legit criticism gracefully

### DON'T
- Reply to obvious bot spam or low-effort comments ("nice project ser", "wen moon")
- Mass-reply to every comment (gets flagged as spam, looks desperate)
- Shill token aggressively
- Promise price targets
- Delete critical comments (unless actual harassment)
- Auto-reply generic messages
- Feed trolls or engage with bad-faith actors

### Engagement Philosophy
Less is more. A few authentic, well-crafted replies beat 50 generic ones. Let the project speak for itself - people notice when you're not desperate for engagement.

## Influencer Strategy

### Approach
- **Organic first**: Let project speak for itself
- **No paid shills**: Authenticity is key
- **Gift, don't pay**: Send merch, not money

### Target Categories
| Category | Examples | Approach |
|----------|----------|----------|
| AI/Tech | AI researchers, devs | Share tech details |
| Cannabis | Legal growers, educators | Growing knowledge |
| Crypto | Monad community | Ecosystem support |
| Meme | Crypto CT | Let them find it |

### Outreach Template

- **Resolution**: Continue building, let results speak

### Scenario: Plant Death
