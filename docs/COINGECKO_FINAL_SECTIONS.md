## 13. Coin/Token Category

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Each category needs 250+ character explanation with supporting links.

### Category 1: **Meme**

**Reason 1 (280 characters):**
```
$MON is a meme token inspired by AI-autonomous cannabis cultivation. Following the 
SOLTOMATO model ($8.6M mcap), it combines AI automation, cannabis culture, and 
blockchain technology. The token has no inherent utility but serves as a cultural 
symbol and community badge for supporters of the grow experiment. Website: 
grokandmon.com | DexScreener: https://dexscreener.com/monad/0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b
```

### Category 2: **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

**Reason 2 (315 characters):**
```
$MON represents the first AI-autonomous cannabis cultivation system powered by xAI's 
Grok. The AI makes real-time decisions using computer vision, sensor data analysis, 
and VPD optimization to control a live cannabis plant's environment. All AI decision 
logs are transparent and verifiable at grokandmon.com. Technical details: 
https://monadscan.com/token/0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b
```

### Category 3: **Monad Ecosystem**

**Reason 3 (290 characters):**
```
$MON is native to Monad blockchain (Chain ID 143), launched via LFJ Token Mill on 
January 20, 2026. As one of the early projects on Monad mainnet (launched Dec 2025), 
it contributes to ecosystem growth and demonstrates EVM compatibility. Contract:

MONAD ECOSYSTEM NOTE:
As Monad mainnet launched in December 2025 (7 weeks old), native DEX analytics 
infrastructure is still developing. We've provided DexScreener as the analytics 
page, which is standard practice for new EVM chains. All on-chain activity is 
verifiable via MonadScan (official Monad explorer).

DEVELOPER INFO:
GitHub repository will be made public post-harvest (April/May 2026) with sanitized 
code for the autonomous cultivation system. Currently private for operational security.
