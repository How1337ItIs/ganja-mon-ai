## Clone/Propagation Phase (Days 1-14)

### Environmental Targets (Research-Backed)

**Humidity:**
- **Target: 75% RH** during development stage (Bilodeau 2019)
- **Up to 90% RH reported** for propagation (Bilodeau 2019)
- Clones lack roots, absorb moisture through leaves
- Gradually reduce to 55-65% after Day 10-14

**Temperature:**
- **Optimal: 25-30°C (77-86°F)** for photosynthesis (Bilodeau 2019)
- **Clone range: 20-26°C (68-79°F)** (acceptable for root establishment)

**VPD:**
- **Target: 0.4-0.8 kPa** (lower than mature veg)
- Lower VPD = less transpiration stress = better for rootless clones

**Light:**
- **PPFD: 200-400 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹** for clones
- **Photoperiod: 18/6** (18 hours on, 6 hours off)
- Start low, increase to full veg intensity over 7-10 days

**Soil Moisture:**
- **Target: 45-55%** (keep moist for root growth)
- **Water threshold: ≤40%** - WATER IMMEDIATELY
- **Critical threshold: <30%** - EMERGENCY watering
- Clones die from underwatering faster than overwatering

### Watering Decision Logic (CRITICAL FIX)

**The Research Says:**
> "Water based on SOIL DRYNESS, not plant stress appearance"

**Correct Logic:**
1. If soil moisture ≤40% (clone) OR ≤30% (veg/flower) → **WATER NOW**
2. Don't wait for visual stress signs (wilting, drooping)
3. "Plant looks healthy" means you caught it early (good!) - **still water**
4. Proactive watering prevents root damage and growth stalling

**Wrong Logic (DON'T DO THIS):**
- ❌ "Sensor says 32%, but plant looks healthy → don't water"
- ❌ "Wait until plant shows stress before watering"
- ❌ "Visual health overrides sensor threshold"

**Sensor vs Visual Assessment:**
- **For WATERING decisions:** Sensor threshold > visual plant health
- **For OTHER issues:** Visual assessment helps (pests, deficiencies, light stress)
- If sensor AND visual soil assessment both say "dry" → WATER (don't wait!)

## Vegetative Phase (Days 15-45)

**Temperature:** 20-30°C (68-86°F) - cannabis acclimated to warmer temps (32°C/23°C day/night) showed higher photosynthesis (Bazzaz et al. 1975)

**Humidity:** 50-60% RH

**VPD:** 0.8-1.2 kPa

**Light:**
- **PPFD: 400-600 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹**
- **Photoperiod: 18/6**
- Cannabis photosynthesis increases up to **1,500 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹** (Chandra 2008)
- Slight decline at 1,500-2,000 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ at 30°C

**Soil Moisture:**
- **Target: 40-50%**
- **Water threshold: ≤35%**

**CO2 Enrichment (Optional):**
- **Elevated CO2 (1000 ppm) increases photosynthesis** (Chandra 2011)
- Strain-specific responses

## Flowering Phase (Days 46-120)

**Temperature:**
- **21-27°C (70-80°F)** day
- **17-25°C (63-77°F)** night
- Optimal photosynthesis: 30°C at high light (Chandra 2008)

**Humidity:**
- **54-64% RH** (Bugbee 2021 trials)
- Traditional recommendation: 40-50% (lower mold risk)

**VPD:**
- **1.0-1.5 kPa** (general horticulture)
- **1.2-1.4 kPa** (Bugbee 2021 actual trials)

**Light:**
- **PPFD: 600-900 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹**
- **900 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ gave higher yield than 750** (Bugbee 2021)
- **Photoperiod: 12/12** (critical for flowering)

**Light Spectrum Effects:**
- **Lower blue fraction (4-10%) = 12% higher yield** than high blue (20%) (Bugbee 2021)
- **UV-B increases THC** in leaves and buds (Lydon 1987)
- **Blue light (450nm) improves cannabinoid content** (Magagnini 2018)
- **Green light REDUCES THC** (Mahlberg 1983)

**Soil Moisture:**
- **Target: 35-45%**
- **Water threshold: ≤30%**

**CO2:**
- **1000 ± 50 ppm optimal** (Bugbee 2021 trials)

**Fertilizer:**
- **EC: 1.2 ± 0.1 mS/cm**
- **pH: 6.8 ± 0.1**
- Optimized N rate: **351 mg N/L** (Caplan 2017)

**Air Circulation:**
- **0.8 m/s at canopy top** (Bugbee 2021)
- "Constant airflow and drier air recommended to prevent plant diseases and mold" (Chandra 2017)

## Harvest Timing

**Trichome Color = Cannabinoid Content (Mahlberg & Kim 2004):**

| Color | Cannabinoid Content | Harvest Decision |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Translucent/Clear-Cloudy** | **HIGHEST** | **OPTIMAL HARVEST WINDOW** |
| Yellow | Lower (declining) | Past peak - harvest ASAP |
| Brown/Black | Lowest (senescent) | Too late - cannabinoids degraded |

**Critical Discovery (Bugbee 2021):**
- **CBD and THC can DECLINE in final 2 weeks** of flowering
- Peak occurs around Week 5-6, then drops
- **Don't wait too long!** - Monitor trichomes weekly

**Harvest Readiness by Effect:**
- **70-80% cloudy, 20-30% clear:** Peak THC, cerebral high
- **80-90% cloudy, 10-20% amber:** Balanced THC/CBN
- **70% cloudy, 30% amber:** More CBN, sedative effect

## Photosynthesis Science

**Light Saturation:**
- Cannabis photosynthesis increases up to **1,500 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹** (Chandra 2008)
- 20% decline at 1,500-2,000 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ at 30°C
- Most crops saturate at 800-1,000 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹
- **Cannabis has VERY HIGH light capacity**

**Temperature × Light Interaction:**
- **Warmer temps (30°C) support higher PPFD** before saturation
- Cooler temps (<25°C) = lower optimal PPFD

**Quantum Yield:**
- Red photons ~25% more efficient than blue for photosynthesis
- Green photons ~5% less efficient than red
- **Practical implication:** Less blue = more yield (confirmed by Bugbee 2021)

## Air Circulation & Mold Prevention

**Research Recommendation:**
- "Constant airflow and drier air are recommended to prevent plant diseases and mold formation" (Chandra 2017)
- **Air velocity: 0.8 m/s at canopy top** (Bugbee 2021)
- Keep circulation fan running 24/7

**Why Air Movement Matters:**
- Strengthens stems (wind response)
- Prevents moisture buildup on leaves (mold/powdery mildew)
- Improves CO2 distribution to leaves
- Reduces vapor pressure at leaf surface (increases transpiration)

## Sensor Accuracy & Calibration

**Soil Moisture Sensors:**
- Can be miscalibrated for specific soil types
- **Expected behavior of working sensor:**
  - Gradual changes over hours/days (not stuck at one value)
  - Increases after watering
  - Decreases as plant uses water
  - Shows 0.5-2% natural variation even in stable conditions

**Signs of Faulty Sensor:**
- Reading stuck at exact same value for hours
- No response to watering
- No response to environmental changes
- Contradicts visual soil assessment AND plant health

**When Sensor is Working:**
- **Trust the sensor threshold!**
- If sensor ≤40% (clone) or ≤30% (veg/flower) → water NOW
- Visual assessment is secondary to numeric threshold

## Common Cultivation Mistakes (To Avoid)

### Mistake #1: Waiting for Plant Stress Before Watering
- ❌ "Plant looks healthy, so don't water despite low soil moisture"
- ✅ "Soil is dry (sensor + visual confirm) → water NOW before stress develops"

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Sensor Data
- ❌ "Sensor says 32%, but I think it's wrong because plant looks fine"
- ✅ "Sensor consistently responds to watering → trust it"

### Mistake #3: Over-Relying on Generic VPD Charts
- ❌ "VPD must be exactly 0.6 kPa for clones or plant will die"
- ✅ "VPD 0.4-0.8 kPa is target range, 0.9-1.0 kPa is acceptable, plant appearance matters too"

### Mistake #4: Catastrophizing Minor Deviations
- ❌ "RH is 61% instead of 65% - CRITICAL EMERGENCY!"
- ✅ "RH 61% when target is 65-75% = minor deviation, plant will adapt"

### Mistake #5: Harvesting Too Late
- ❌ "Wait until all trichomes are amber for maximum potency"
- ✅ "Harvest when 70-90% cloudy - cannabinoids degrade if you wait too long"

## Yield Benchmarks

**Research Studies:**
- **500-750 g/m²** dry flower (Bugbee 2021)
- **142-743 g/m²** (various studies, Bilodeau 2019 Table 1)
- **0.9-1.6 g per watt** of HPS (Potter & Duncombe 2012)

**Factors Affecting Yield:**
1. Light intensity (PPFD)
2. Light duration (DLI = daily light integral)
3. CO2 enrichment
4. Temperature optimization
5. Genetics/strain
6. Plant density

**Photon Conversion Efficacy:**
- **0.22-0.36 g dry flower per mole of photons** (Bugbee 2021)
- Use this to estimate yield from PPFD and photoperiod
