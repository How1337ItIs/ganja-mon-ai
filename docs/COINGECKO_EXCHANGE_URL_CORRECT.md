# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Exchange Trading Information - CORRECTED

## CoinGecko Requirement for AMMs

CoinGecko says: **"In case of AMM such as Uniswap, please link to the analytics page of the pair."**

Example: `https://info.uniswap.org/tokens/[ADDRESS]`

## ✅ CORRECT ANSWER FOR $MON

### Exchange Trading Pair #1

```
Exchange Name: 
DexScreener

Exchange Trade URL (Analytics Page):
https://dexscreener.com/monad/0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b
```

## 📊 Why DexScreener?

**LFJ Token Mill is an AMM** (like Uniswap), but:
- ❌ LFJ doesn't have a separate `info.lfj.gg` subdomain
- ❌ Monad is too new (Dec 2025) for mature analytics infrastructure
- ✅ **DexScreener is the standard analytics aggregator** for new chains
- ✅ CoinGecko accepts DexScreener for chains without native info pages

**DexScreener provides:**
- Price charts
- Volume data
- Liquidity metrics
- Trading pairs
- Holder information

This is exactly what CoinGecko needs to verify your token.

## ❌ WRONG ANSWER (Don't Use This)

```
❌ Exchange Trade URL: https://lfj.gg/monad/trade/0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b
```

**Why it's wrong:** This is the **trade page**, not the **analytics page**. CoinGecko specifically asks for analytics (like `info.uniswap.org`), not the swap interface.

## 🎯 If Form Has "Additional Information" Field

Add this note to explain:

```
$MON trades on LFJ Token Mill, an AMM on Monad blockchain. As Monad mainnet 
launched in December 2025, native analytics infrastructure is still developing. 
We've provided the DexScreener analytics page, which aggregates comprehensive 
data (price, volume, liquidity, charts) from LFJ Token Mill. This follows the 
standard practice for new EVM chains where dedicated info subdomains (like 
info.uniswap.org) are not yet available. Contract address: 
0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b
```

## 📋 Complete Section 3 Answer

**Copy-Paste Ready:**

```
Trading Pair #1

Exchange Name: DexScreener

Exchange Trade URL: https://dexscreener.com/monad/0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b
```

## ✅ Why This Will Be Accepted

1. **DexScreener is recognized** by CoinGecko as a legitimate analytics provider
2. **Provides all required data** (price, volume, liquidity)
3. **Standard for new chains** - CoinGecko knows Monad is new
4. **Follows the "analytics page" requirement** - it's not a trade interface
5. **Verifiable** - CoinGecko reviewers can see real trading data
