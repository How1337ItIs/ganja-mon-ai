# Community Token Language

## One-liner
An AI is growing cannabis. Watch it happen. $MON is how you join the community.

## Short Description (Twitter bio / landing page)

Grok AI is autonomously growing cannabis in a sensor-filled grow room. Every decision—lights, water, climate—is made by AI in real-time. No human intervention. Just vibes and photosynthesis.

$MON is the community token. Hold it if you want. Don't if you don't. We're just here to watch a plant grow.

## Longer Description (About page)

### The Project

We built a grow room with 13+ sensors monitoring everything: temperature, humidity, CO2, soil moisture, light intensity, leaf temperature, VPD—all of it. An AI (Grok) reads this data and makes every decision about how to care for the plant. When to water. When to dim the lights. When to kick on the fans.

No schedules. No human override. The AI runs the show.

We're livestreaming the whole thing. Watch the plant grow. Watch the AI make decisions. See if it works.

### The Token

$MON exists because we wanted a way for people to be part of this. That's it.

There's no utility. No governance. No roadmap promises. No guaranteed anything.

It's a community token. If you think this project is cool and want to hold some $MON while you watch, go for it. If not, that's fine too. You can still watch the stream.

### What We're NOT Saying

- We're not saying $MON will go up in value
- We're not saying holding $MON gets you anything
- We're not saying we'll build features for token holders
- We're not making promises about the future

### What We ARE Saying

- We're building something weird and fun
- You can watch it happen
- There's a token if you want to be part of the community
- That's literally it

## Event Language (if/when you do a harvest meetup)

### Do NOT say:
- "Top holders get invited"
- "Hold X amount to qualify"
- "Exclusive holder event"
- "Token holder benefits"

### DO say:
- "We're having a community meetup in Northern California when we harvest"
- "If you're in the area and want to come hang, DM us"
- "It's not a token thing, it's just a party"
- "We're celebrating the harvest with whoever wants to show up"

## FAQ

**Is $MON a utility token?**
No. It doesn't do anything. It's just a community token.

**Do I get anything for holding $MON?**
No.

**Will there be governance?**
No.

**What's the roadmap?**
Grow the plant. See what happens. Maybe grow another one.

**Is this legal?**
We're following California Prop 64 guidelines for personal cultivation (6 plants max, adults 21+). The token is on Monad and has nothing to do with cannabis sales.

**Why should I buy $MON?**
We're not saying you should. If you think the project is cool and want to be part of the community, that's up to you. We're not financial advisors and this isn't investment advice.

## Disclaimers

$MON is a community token with no intrinsic value, utility, or governance rights. Purchasing $MON does not constitute an investment, does not create any legal relationship with the project creators, and does not entitle holders to any goods, services, profits, or benefits of any kind.

This is an experimental art/technology project. The token exists for community participation only. Do not purchase $MON with the expectation of profit. There is no team allocation, no roadmap, and no promises.

Not financial advice. Not investment advice. Just a plant and an AI.
