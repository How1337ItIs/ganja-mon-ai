Ganja Mon ($MON) is the world's first AI-autonomous cannabis cultivation system powered by xAI's Grok, launched on Monad blockchain on January 20, 2026.

**Project Genesis:**
Inspired by SOLTOMATO (an AI tomato cultivation project that reached $8.6M market cap on Solana), Ganja Mon evolved the concept with key differentiators: Grok AI instead of Claude, Monad instead of Solana, and cannabis instead of tomatoes. The project combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence, IoT hardware, and blockchain technology to create a fully transparent, verifiable autonomous agricultural experiment.

**Technical Implementation:**
The system uses a Chromebook controller running xAI's Grok AI with 30-minute autonomous decision cycles. Real hardware includes Govee WiFi sensors (temperature, humidity, CO2), Kasa smart plugs (lights, pump, fan), and Ecowitt soil sensors. A Logitech C270 webcam provides live visual monitoring. The AI analyzes sensor data and plant health via computer vision, then autonomously controls environmental conditions using VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) targeting optimized for each growth stage.

**Current Status:**
The project launched January 18-20, 2026. As of **February 12, 2026**, the active Granddaddy Purple Runtz clone was at Day 21 (seedling/early vegetative). The system runs as a unified agent (FastAPI HAL + OpenClaw AI orchestrator + trading agent) on a Chromebook server with 54 loaded skills, 10 autonomous cron jobs, and three-layer monitoring. The token is bridged cross-chain (Monad + Base via Wormhole NTT). Registered as ERC-8004 Agent #4 on Monad with A2A micropayments (x402) operational. Live webcam, sensor data, AI decision logs, and Rasta patois plant guidance at grokandmon.com.

**Legal Compliance:**
The cultivation is fully legal under California law, which permits adults 21+ to grow up to 6 plants for personal use. The project emphasizes transparency, education, and authentic Rasta/cannabis culture.

## 🎯 Ultra-Short Version (100 words)

Ganja Mon ($MON) is the first AI-autonomous cannabis cultivation system on blockchain, launched January 20, 2026 on Monad. Powered by xAI's Grok AI, the system uses real IoT hardware (Govee sensors, Kasa smart plugs, webcam) to autonomously monitor and control a live cannabis plant's environment via 30-minute decision cycles. Inspired by SOLTOMATO's $8.6M success, Ganja Mon differentiates with Grok AI, Monad blockchain, and cannabis culture. As of February 12, 2026: 97 organic holders, ~$55K market cap snapshot, and 100+ Telegram members. Fully transparent operations with live telemetry at grokandmon.com. Legal California personal cultivation.
