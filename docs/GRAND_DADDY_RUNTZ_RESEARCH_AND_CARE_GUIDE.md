# Grand Daddy Runtz (GDP × Runtz) — Research + Care Guide

**Context:** This guide is written for a clone labeled **Grand Daddy Runtz** sourced from **Rabbit Hole Collective / Rabbit Hole Clones (Fairfield, CA)**.

## 1) Research summary (what we can verify)

### Verified lineage (source: Rabbit Hole menu)
Rabbit Hole Clones’ published weekly menu explicitly lists:

- **Grand Daddy Runtz clones/snips — `[GDP x Runtz]`**

Source: `https://sfbayareaclones.com/current-clone-menu`

### Parent-strain reference anchors (for expectations)
Because clone sellers often use shorthand names, the most reliable way to set expectations is to anchor to well-documented parent profiles:

- **Runtz (Zkittlez × Gelato)**  
  - Leafly lists dominant terpenes: **caryophyllene, limonene, myrcene**  
  - Leafly grow info: **~63 days / 7–9 weeks** flowering (reported)  
  Source: `https://leafly.com/strains/runtz`

- **Granddaddy Purple (GDP)**  
  - Leafly lists terpenes: **myrcene, pinene, caryophyllene**  
  - Leafly notes best results with **excellent air circulation**, and indicates indoor harvest around **~60 days**

### Practical “Grand Daddy Runtz” expectation (GDP × Runtz cross)
Given **GDP × Runtz**, plan for:

- **Bud structure:** dense, resin-heavy colas (high bag appeal; higher mold risk if humidity/airflow aren’t controlled)
- **Aroma/flavor direction:** grape/berry depth from GDP + sweet fruit/candy + “gas” notes common in Runtz-family cultivars
- **Effects direction:** typically euphoric/uplifting onset (Runtz) that settles into deeper body relaxation (GDP), depending on phenotype
- **Flowering window:** commonly **~8–10 weeks** for many GDP/Runtz-family runs; verify with plant maturity (trichomes, pistil fade, bract swell)

## 2) Care guide (clone → harvest)

> **Goal:** keep the clone healthy, build an airy structure, then run a clean, low-mold flower cycle that preserves terpenes.

### Strain-specific notes (GDP × Runtz)
- **Density is the main risk:** plan for tight, resin-heavy buds. Prioritize in-canopy airflow and lower RH in late flower.
- **Nitrogen sensitivity:** GDP-leaning phenos can claw/darken if N is pushed hard. Keep veg N moderate and taper earlier in flower.
- **Stress-reactive genetics:** Runtz/Gelato-family lines can throw intersex traits when stressed. Avoid stacking stress (heavy defol + transplant + flip), avoid big VPD/temp swings, and eliminate light leaks.
- **Training bias:** LST + canopy spread beats repeated high-stress topping. If you top, do it once when clearly vigorous.
- **Defol timing:** big cleanup right before flip (lollipop) + one follow-up after stretch (~day 21). After that: surgical only.
- **Support early:** set net/stakes before week 4 so you’re not propping collapsing colas late.

### Phase 0 — Intake & stabilization (first 72 hours)
- **Quarantine:** ideally isolate for **7–10 days** (common clone pest risk: mites/thrips).
- **Light:** gentle/moderate intensity; avoid “day-1 blast.”
- **Environment (clone-friendly):**
  - **Temp:** 72–78°F (22–26°C)
  - **RH:** **65–75%**
  - **Airflow:** light breeze (avoid leaf flutter/windburn)
- **Watering:** small sips; don’t keep the root zone soaked.

**Ready-to-up-pot signals:** new growth resumes + roots fill the plug/cup.

### Phase 1 — Early vegetative (roots + structure)
- **Photoperiod:** 18/6
- **Targets:**
  - **Temp:** 72–82°F (22–28°C)
  - **RH:** 55–65%
  - **VPD (rough):** ~0.8–1.2 kPa
- **Nutrition (generic guidance):**
  - Start **light** and ramp slowly; this cross can get leafy if overfed N early.
  - Keep irrigation consistent; avoid big wet/dry swings while establishing.
- **Training (high ROI for GDP×Runtz):**
  - **LST early** to open the plant and prevent a dense interior.
  - **Top once** (optional) after the plant is clearly vigorous, then spread branches.
  - Remove only the **weakest lower growth** at first; don’t “strip” a small clone.

### Soil-specific care (simple, reliable defaults)
- **pH (soil):** target **~6.3–6.8** at the root zone.
- **Watering cadence:** water thoroughly, then wait until the pot gets *noticeably* lighter and the top 1–2" is dry before watering again. Avoid keeping soil constantly wet (slows roots and invites gnats).
- **Runoff:** in soil, you don’t need heavy runoff every time. Occasional light runoff is fine; constant runoff can wash nutrition out.
- **Top-dress vs bottle-feed (pick one and keep it consistent):**
  - **Living soil / top-dress:** top-dress lightly in veg, then again early flower; keep microbe life stable (avoid harsh sterilizers).
  - **Bottle nutrients in soil:** use lower EC than coco/hydro, especially on GDP-leaning phenos; increase only if you see clear hunger.
- **Cal/Mag:** add only if your water is very soft/RO or you see classic deficiency signs—don’t auto-overdo it.
- **Fungus gnats prevention:** sticky traps + let the top layer dry; consider a thin layer of sand or mosquito bits if they appear.

### Phase 2 — Pre-flip prep (7–10 days before flower)
- **Objective:** a flat, airy canopy that won’t trap humidity later.
- **Do:**
  - **Lollipop** the bottom **15–25%** (clean lower branches that won’t reach the canopy).
  - Remove inward-facing shoots that will never get light.
- **Avoid stacking stress:** don’t do heavy defol + transplant + flip all at once.

### Phase 3 — Flower (12/12)

#### Weeks 1–3 (stretch)
- **Targets:**
  - **Temp:** 70–80°F (21–27°C)
  - **RH:** 45–55% (begin trending down)
  - **VPD (rough):** ~1.0–1.4 kPa
- **Canopy:** light defol where leaves overlap and block airflow to bud sites.

#### Weeks 4–7 (bulk + resin)
- **Targets:**
  - **RH:** 40–50% (lower end if buds are very dense)
- **Support:** trellis/stakes recommended (top-heavy colas are common).
- **Airflow:** prioritize moving air *through* the canopy, not just above it.

#### Weeks 8–10 (ripen / finish window)
- **Targets:**
  - **Temp:** 65–75°F (18–24°C) if possible
  - **RH:** 35–45% (mold prevention)
- **Harvest timing:** use maturity signals over calendar (trichome look, bract swell, pistil recession).

## 3) IPM + mold prevention checklist (clone-born reality)

- **Daily:** quick leaf-under inspection + look at new growth tips
- **Weekly:** sticky traps + canopy airflow audit (dead-air pockets)
- **Late flower:** avoid oily foliar sprays; prioritize environment + removal of problem leaves

---

## 4) Dry & cure (preserve the candy/grape terps)

- **Dry:** gentle airflow, cool/dim, aim for a slow dry (often ~7–14 days depending on conditions)
- **Cure:** airtight container, burp early, then taper; store cool/dark
