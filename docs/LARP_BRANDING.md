## Visual Identity

### Color Palette

**Primary**:
- **LARP Purple**: `#8B5CF6` (theatrical, mystical, crypto-native)
- **LARP Gold**: `#F59E0B` (premium, treasure, legendary)

**Secondary**:
- **Deep Black**: `#0F172A` (dark mode native)
- **Off-White**: `#F8FAFC` (clean contrast)

**Accent**:
- **Neon Green**: `#10B981` (active state, "live" indicator)
- **Danger Red**: `#EF4444` (warnings, errors)

### Typography

**Headings**: DM Sans Bold (modern, clean, readable)
**Body**: Inter (Web3 standard, excellent readability)
**Code/Mono**: JetBrains Mono (for wallet addresses, tickers)

### Logo Concepts

**Option 1: Theater Mask**
- Classic comedy/tragedy masks, but digital/pixelated
- One mask = input (your voice), other mask = output (character)
- Simple, recognizable, works at small sizes

**Option 2: Chameleon**
- Animal that "changes identity" = perfect metaphor
- Playful, friendly, less serious than mask
- Great for mascot/character development

**Option 3: Voice Waveform Morph**
- Waveform that transforms from one shape to another
- Technical, shows "transformation" visually
- More professional, less memetic

**Recommendation**: **Theater masks** (Option 1) - most aligned with LARP branding, instantly communicates concept

### Visual Style

**Aesthetic**: Dark mode cyberpunk meets theatrical stage
- Dark backgrounds with neon accents
- Glowing persona cards (like character select screens in games)
- Theatrical lighting effects (spotlights, stage curtains as UI elements)
- Pixel art or voxel art characters for personas (retro gaming + Web3 vibes)

**Inspiration**:
- Character select screens (Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter)
- Discord dark mode
- Solana dApp aesthetics (Jupiter, Tensor)
- Theater/stage production vibes

## Messaging Do's and Don'ts

- **Community-first**: "You own this. We just built it."
- **Educate on novelty**: "World's first AI personality engine for streaming"

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Take yourself too seriously**: No "revolutionizing" or "disrupting"

Built on Solana via apps.fun, $LARP token holders earn USDC revenue share through staking while unlocking bonus credits and premium personas. The platform represents a novel intersection of AI voice technology and Web3 token economics."
