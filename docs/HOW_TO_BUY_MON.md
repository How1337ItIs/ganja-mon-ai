- Swapping for $MON token
- Bridge fees (if bridging)

**Where to Get Native MON:**
- **Coinbase** - Buy MON directly

## Method 1: Buy on Centralized Exchange (CEX)

**Best for:** Beginners, users who want to buy with fiat (USD, EUR, etc.)

### Step 1: Choose an Exchange

**Tier 1 Exchanges (Recommended):**
- ✅ **Coinbase** - Easiest for US users, supports fiat deposits

- ✅ **Bybit** - High liquidity, MON/USDT pairs
- ✅ **MEXC** - Good alternative

**Tier 2 Exchanges:**

- Deposit USD, EUR, or other fiat currency
- Fees vary by exchange (typically 1-3%)

**Option B: Crypto Deposit**
- Send existing crypto (BTC, ETH, USDT) to exchange
- Lower fees than fiat deposits

### Step 4: Buy Native MON Token

1. Search for "MON" or "Monad" on the exchange
2. **Important:** Make sure you're buying **MON (Monad's native token)**, not $MON (Ganja Mon)
3. Place a market or limit order
4. Confirm purchase

### Step 5: Withdraw to Your Wallet

1. Go to "Withdraw" section
2. Select "MON" token

5. Confirm withdrawal
6. Wait for confirmation (usually 5-30 minutes)

**⚠️ Important:** Always double-check you're withdrawing to Monad network, not Ethereum or another chain!

### Step 6: Bridge or Swap to $MON

Once you have native MON in your wallet:
- See [Method 2](#method-2-bridge-from-another-chain) to bridge from another chain
- See [Method 4](#method-4-buy-on-dex-aggregator) to swap MON → $MON on a DEX

### Step 1: Choose Your Bridge

**Recommended: Across Protocol** (https://across.to)
- Fastest: 4 seconds
- Cheapest: ~$0.011 per transfer
- Supports: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Solana → Monad

**Alternative: Socket/Bungee** (https://bungee.exchange)

- Compares all bridges
- Shows cheapest option

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

3. **Token:** Select the token you want to bridge (ETH, USDC, SOL, etc.)

### Step 4: Enter Amount

1. Enter amount to bridge
2. Review estimated:
   - Bridge fee

---

## Method 4: Buy on DEX Aggregator

**Best for:** Best prices, after token graduation, swapping existing tokens

DEX aggregators find the best prices across all Monad DEXs (Uniswap, Curve, etc.).

### Step 1: Choose a DEX Aggregator

**Recommended Options:**
- **Jupiter** (if bridged to Solana) - https://jup.ag

### Step 3: Select Tokens

1. **From:** Select token you have (MON, USDC, ETH, etc.)
2. **To:** Search for "$MON" or "Ganja Mon"
3. **Important:** Verify contract address matches your token!

### Step 4: Enter Amount

1. Enter amount to swap
2. Review:
   - Amount of $MON you'll receive
   - Price impact
   - Slippage tolerance

## Adding $MON to Your Wallet

Your $MON token may not appear automatically. Here's how to add it:

### Auto-Add Button (Recommended)

**For Website/DApp Integration:**

If you're building a website or dApp, you can add a "Add $MON to Wallet" button that uses the `wallet_watchAsset` RPC method:

```javascript
// Add $MON to Wallet Button
async function addMONToWallet() {
  try {
    await window.ethereum.request({
      method: 'wallet_watchAsset',
      params: {
        type: 'ERC20',
        options: {
          address: '0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b', // $MON token contract address
          symbol: 'MON',
          decimals: 18,
          image: 'https://grokandmon.com/token-logo.png', // Optional: token logo URL
        },
      },
    });
    alert('$MON token added to wallet!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding token:', error);
    alert('Failed to add token. Please add manually.');
  }
}
```

**HTML Button:**
```html
<button onclick="addMONToWallet()" class="add-token-btn">
  Add $MON to Wallet
</button>
```

**Benefits:**
- One-click token addition
- No manual address entry
- Prevents errors
- Better user experience

**Disclaimer:** This guide is for informational purposes only.
