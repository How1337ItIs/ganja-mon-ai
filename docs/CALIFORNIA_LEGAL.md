## Proposition 64 (Adult Use)

California legalized adult-use cannabis via Proposition 64 in 2016. Here are the key rules for home cultivation:

### ✅ What's Legal

| Rule | Limit |
|------|-------|
| **Age** | Must be 21+ years old |
| **Plant Count** | Maximum **6 plants per residence** (not per person) |
| **Location** | Must be in a **private residence** you own or rent (with landlord permission) |
| **Visibility** | Plants must **not be visible** from a public place |
| **Security** | Must be in a **locked space** |
| **Possession** | Up to 28.5g dried flower / 8g concentrate at a time |
| **Storage** | No limit on personal-use harvest stored at home |

### ❌ What's NOT Legal

- Growing more than 6 plants total in your residence
- Growing outdoors if visible from public areas
- Selling, trading, or gifting more than 1oz at a time
- Growing in a location accessible to minors
- Growing where prohibited by your landlord/lease
- Growing in federally subsidized housing

## Local Ordinances Matter!

California allows cities and counties to add restrictions. **Check your local laws:**

### Cities That Ban or Restrict Home Grows
Some California cities have additional restrictions or bans. Examples:
- Some cities limit outdoor grows but allow indoor
- Some require registration or permits
- Some have specific setback requirements

**Always check:**
- Your city's municipal code
- Your county ordinances
- Your HOA rules (if applicable)
- Your lease agreement (if renting)

## Best Practices for Compliance

### 1. Keep It Private
- Grow in a **tent or dedicated room**
- Use **carbon filters** to manage odor
- Don't discuss your grow publicly

### 2. Secure Your Grow
- Keep grow space **locked**
- Not accessible by minors
- Document your security measures

### 3. Stay Under Limits
- **6 plants maximum** per household
- This project tracks plant count for you
- Never exceed this limit

### 4. Document Everything
- Keep a grow journal (this system logs automatically)
- Document strains, dates, and purposes
- Useful if ever questioned

## Medical Cannabis (MCRSA)

If you have a **medical marijuana recommendation**:
- May be allowed to grow more than 6 plants with county approval
- Check your county's rules for medical cultivation
- Keep your recommendation current
