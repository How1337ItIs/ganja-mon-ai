## Logo

Both platforms want a **high-resolution logo, transparent background preferred**.

- **Local asset:** `assets/MON_ganja_mon_token_logo.png` or `assets/MON_official_logo.jpg`
- **Before submitting:** Host the image at a stable public URL, e.g.:
  - On **grokandmon.com** (e.g. `https://grokandmon.com/images/MON_token_logo.png`), or
  - **GitHub** (if repo is public):  
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[USER]/[REPO]/main/assets/MON_ganja_mon_token_logo.png`

Use that URL for **Logo URL** in both forms.

## CoinGecko — step-by-step

1. Open: https://www.coingecko.com/request-form?locale=en  
2. **Request type:** Select **"Request to List Coin / Token"**.  
3. Fill in:
   - Project name, website, **whitepaper** (link or "N/A" if none)
   - **Explorer link** → use Monad token/contract link above
   - **Smart contract address** → `0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b`
   - **Socials:** Twitter, Telegram (and any others they ask for)
   - **Token symbol** → MON
   - **Logo URL** → your public logo URL
   - **CoinMarketCap link** → leave blank or add after CMC lists
4. **Email:** Use a professional address (e.g. project or your main).  
5. **Submit.** Typical reply: 5–7 business days (can be longer).  
6. **Do not** send duplicate requests; wait at least 2 weeks before following up.

## CoinMarketCap — step-by-step

1. Open: https://coinmarketcap.com/request/  
2. **Request type:** Select **"1 - [New Listing] Add cryptoasset"**.  
3. Fill in all required fields using the pre-filled data above (name, symbol, chain, contract, website, explorer, socials, logo URL, trading links).  
4. **Email:** Professional address.  
5. **Submit.**  
   - There is **no fixed timeline** or guarantee; evaluation is case-by-case.  
   - Do **not** submit duplicate requests.  
   - You can send a **new request** later with updates (e.g. new DEX, volume, partnerships) instead of resubmitting the same one.

**Evaluation factors (from CMC):**

- **Community interest** — adoption, usefulness  
- **Trading volume** — liquidity, price discovery  
- **Uniqueness** — not a trivial fork  
- **Project age** — some track record preferred  

They state: *"Inflating volume, traffic, or social media metrics will not increase chances of listing."*

## Checklist before you submit

- [ ] **Logo** hosted at a public, stable URL (not a local path).  
- [ ] **Contract address** is the **token** contract: `0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b` (not the Token Mill market).  
- [ ] **Explorer link** uses Monad (e.g. monadscan.com) so they can verify on-chain.  
- [ ] **Website** (grokandmon.com) is live and reflects the project.  
- [ ] **Twitter** @ganjamonai and **Telegram** are linked and active.  
- [ ] **Whitepaper:** If none, use "N/A" or a short doc link where CoinGecko asks.  
- [ ] **Trade link** points to a live market (LFJ Token Mill / DexScreener).

## After submitting

- **CoinGecko:** Wait 5–7+ business days; follow up only after 2+ weeks if no reply.  
- **CoinMarketCap:** No set timeline; avoid duplicate submissions. Send a **new request** later with progress (e.g. "MON now on DexScreener, LFJ, volume X") if you want to update them.  
- **CMC Priority (CMCP):** Paid fast-track exists if you need guaranteed turnaround; see [CMC Priority (CMCP)](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP).
