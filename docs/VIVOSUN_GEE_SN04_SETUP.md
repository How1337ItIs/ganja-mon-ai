## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Unbox and Inventory ✅

Check that you have all components:
- [ ] Tent fabric (main body)
- [ ] Metal frame poles (corner pieces, base poles, vertical poles, top frame)
- [ ] Connectors/couplers
- [ ] Floor tray (waterproof base)
- [ ] Support bars (for hanging lights)
- [ ] Zippers and doors
- [ ] Any included accessories

**Clear a flat area** - You'll need space to lay out and assemble the tent.

---

### Step 2: Assemble the Frame 🔧

1. **Connect Base Frame**
   - Connect corner pieces to base poles
   - Form a rectangle/square on the ground
   - This is the foundation of your tent

2. **Add Vertical Poles**
   - Attach vertical corner poles to the base corners
   - Stand them up to create the tent's height
   - Make sure all corners are properly connected

3. **Complete Top Frame**
   - Connect horizontal bars at the top
   - Connect all top corners
   - Frame should now be a complete cube/rectangle structure

4. **Check Stability**
   - Frame should stand on its own
   - All connections should be secure
   - No wobbly or loose joints

### Step 3: Install Tent Fabric 🎪

1. **Unfold the Fabric**
   - Spread the tent fabric flat on the ground
   - Identify which side is the front (door side)

2. **Slide Frame into Fabric**
   - Vivosun tents typically use **sleeve design**
   - Slide the assembled frame into the fabric sleeves
   - Work from bottom to top
   - Make sure fabric is oriented correctly (doors facing front)

3. **Raise the Tent**
   - Once frame is in sleeves, lift the entire structure
   - Tent should stand upright
   - Fabric should be taut, not sagging

4. **Zip Up Doors**
   - Test all zippers to ensure they work smoothly
   - Close all doors to check fit
   - Make sure fabric isn't twisted

### Step 4: Install Support Bars 💡

1. **Insert Crossbars**
   - The GEE SN04 should have support bars for hanging lights
   - Insert these at the top of the tent
   - They typically slide through loops or attach to the frame

2. **Test Weight Capacity**
   - Check tent specifications for max weight
   - Usually 50-100 lbs depending on size
   - Don't exceed this limit

---

### Step 5: Install Floor Tray 🛡️

1. **Place Floor Tray**
   - Insert the waterproof floor tray at the bottom
   - It should fit snugly inside the tent
   - This catches spills and protects your floor

2. **Secure if Needed**
   - Some models have velcro or clips to secure the tray
   - Make sure it's flat and not bunched up

---

### Step 6: Set Up Ventilation Ports 🌬️

1. **Locate Ventilation Holes**
   - Vivosun tents have pre-cut ventilation ports
   - Usually on top (exhaust) and bottom (intake)
   - May have removable fabric covers

2. **Install Ducting (if needed)**
   - Connect exhaust fan to top port
   - Connect intake to bottom port
   - Use duct clamps to secure

3. **Check for Light Leaks**
   - Close all doors
   - Turn off room lights
   - Look for any light coming through ports
   - Cover unused ports with included covers

---

### Step 7: Final Checks ✅

1. **Zipper Test**
   - [ ] All zippers open and close smoothly
   - [ ] No snags or catches
   - [ ] Doors seal properly

2. **Light Leak Test**
   - [ ] Close tent completely
   - [ ] Turn off all room lights
   - [ ] Check for light coming through:
     - Zippers
     - Ventilation ports
     - Seams
     - Observation windows (if any)

3. **Stability Check**
   - [ ] Tent stands stable
   - [ ] No wobbling
   - [ ] Frame connections are tight

4. **Space Check**
   - [ ] Tent fits in your designated space
   - [ ] Enough room for equipment (lights, fans, etc.)
   - [ ] Easy access to doors

## 🔧 Installing Your Equipment

### Hanging Grow Lights

1. **Attach Rope Hangers**
   - Use adjustable rope hangers (usually included or buy separately)
   - Attach to support bars at top of tent
   - Adjust height based on plant stage:
     - Seedling: 24-30 inches
     - Vegetative: 18-24 inches
     - Flowering: 12-18 inches

2. **Connect Power**
   - Run power cord through designated port
   - Use smart plug (like your Kasa/Tapo plugs) for automation
   - Test light turns on/off properly

### Installing Fans

1. **Exhaust Fan**
   - Hang from top support bars or mount to top port
   - Connect to carbon filter (if using)
   - Run ducting out of top ventilation port

2. **Circulation Fan**
   - Clip fan to tent pole or hang from support bar
   - Position to create air movement
   - Don't point directly at plants (too strong)

3. **Intake (if needed)**
   - Passive intake usually sufficient for smaller tents
   - Or install small intake fan at bottom port

### Installing Sensors

1. **Temperature/Humidity Sensor**
   - Place at plant canopy height
   - Away from direct light/heat
   - Your Govee H5179 can be placed inside

2. **Camera**
   - Mount webcam (Logitech C270) to view plants
   - Position to see full canopy
   - Run USB cable through port

### Problem: Tent Wobbles
- **Solution:** Check all frame connections are tight
- Make sure tent is on level surface
