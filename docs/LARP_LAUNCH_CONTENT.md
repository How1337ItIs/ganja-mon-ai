Thread 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
```
Voicemod changes your pitch.
ElevenLabs clones voices.

But neither transforms your PERSONALITY.

You say: "The plant looks good"
Rasta Mon says: "[chuckles] Ya mon! Di herb lookin' irie today, blessed vibes! 🌿"

That's the difference. That's LARP.
```

**Tweet 3 (How It Works)**
```
Here's the magic:

Your voice → Deepgram STT
↓
xAI Grok LLM (transforms to character personality)
↓
ElevenLabs TTS (outputs in character voice)
↓
Your stream (sub-500ms latency)

Full AI personality engine. First of its kind.
```

✅ Bonus credits (25-50% more value)

### FAQ

**Q: What makes LARP different from Voicemod?**
A: Voicemod changes how you sound (pitch, effects). LARP transforms what you say into character personalities via AI. You say "looks good", Rasta Mon says "ya mon, blessed vibes!"

**Q: Is this just voice cloning?**
A: No. Voice cloning (ElevenLabs) makes you sound like someone else but keeps your words. LARP rewrites your speech in-character with personality, emotion tags, and signature phrases.

**Q: What's the latency?**
A: Sub-500ms. Fast enough for natural conversation, streaming, Discord calls.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Buy credits with USDC (100 credits = $10). Hold $LARP for bonuses: Silver tier (500 $LARP) = +25% credits, 100 free credits/month.

**Q: Can I create my own persona?**
A: Yes! Platinum tier (5000+ $LARP) unlocks custom persona builder. Or wait for persona marketplace (NFTs coming soon).

**Q: Is $LARP a security?**
A: No. $LARP is a utility token (bonuses, staking, governance). Payments are in USDC. Not an investment.

## Press Release

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**LARP Protocol Launches as First Token-Gated AI Personality Transformer on Solana**

*Platform enables real-time character transformation for streamers using xAI Grok and ElevenLabs*

[CITY, DATE] — LARP Protocol, the world's first AI personality engine for live streaming, officially launched today on apps.fun with its $LARP utility token. Unlike traditional voice changers that alter pitch or clone voices, LARP transforms users' speech into distinct character personalities in real-time using a proprietary AI pipeline.

The platform combines Deepgram speech-to-text, xAI's Grok large language model, and ElevenLabs text-to-speech to create what founder [NAME] calls "professional LARPing" - enabling streamers, gamers, and content creators to become characters like "Rasta Mon" (Jamaican stoner), "Valley Girl" (California teen), or "Wise Wizard" (mystical sage) with sub-500ms latency.

**Token-Gated Innovation**

Built on Solana via apps.fun, $LARP introduces a novel token economics model combining stablecoin payments with token utility. Users purchase credits with USDC for platform usage, while $LARP token holdings provide:
- Bonus credit multipliers (25-100% more value)
- Free monthly credits (up to 500/month)
- USDC staking rewards (25% of platform revenue)
- Governance rights for persona selection

"We were streaming with our Rasta voice pipeline and realized - why limit this to one persona?" said [NAME], founder of LARP Protocol. "What if anyone could become any character, anytime? That's LARP. It's absurd. It's genius. The LARP is real."

**Market Opportunity**

The voice modification market is dominated by traditional tools like Voicemod (6M+ users, pitch-shifting focused) and AI tools like ElevenLabs (voice cloning focused). LARP occupies a new category: real-time AI personality transformation for streaming, with Web3 community ownership.

Launch personas include Rasta Mon, Valley Girl, Wise Wizard, and News Anchor, with 10+ characters planned by month three. A persona marketplace enabling user-created characters and NFT voices is planned for later this year.

**Availability**

$LARP is available now on apps.fun with a $200,000 fully diluted valuation target. The platform supports OBS Studio, Discord, Twitter Spaces, and major streaming platforms.

For more information, visit larp.fun or join the Discord at discord.gg/larp.
