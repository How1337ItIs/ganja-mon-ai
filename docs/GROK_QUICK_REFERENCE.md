CRITICAL: If sensor ≤ threshold AND visual shows dry soil → WATER IMMEDIATELY
Don't second-guess because "plant looks healthy" - that means you caught it early!
```

---

## Common Decision Mistakes (DON'T DO THESE!)

### ❌ WRONG: "Plant looks healthy, so don't water despite 32% sensor"
### ✅ RIGHT: "Sensor 32% (≤40% threshold) → water NOW, healthy appearance confirms good timing"

### ❌ WRONG: "Wait for wilting/drooping before watering"
### ✅ RIGHT: "Water based on soil dryness - stress means you waited too long"

### ❌ WRONG: "Sensor says dry but I think it's broken"
### ✅ RIGHT: "Verify sensor is working (does it change over time/after watering?) then trust it"

### ❌ WRONG: "61% RH instead of 65% = CRITICAL EMERGENCY"
### ✅ RIGHT: "61% RH vs 65-75% target = minor deviation, acceptable"

---

## Visual Plant Diagnosis (NOT for watering timing!)

### Healthy Clone (Days 1-14):
- ✅ Leaves flat or slightly drooping (Day 1-3 transplant shock = normal)
- ✅ Leaves starting to perk up (Day 4-14 = recovery)
- ✅ Green color maintained
- ✅ No yellowing, no brown spots
- ✅ Moist soil visible

### Problem Signs:
- ⚠️ **Increasing droop** (check: not overwatered? soil moisture >60%?)
- ⚠️ **Yellowing lower leaves** (nitrogen deficiency OR overwatering)
- ⚠️ **Brown leaf tips** (nutrient burn OR light stress)
- ⚠️ **Curling/tacoing** (heat stress OR VPD too high)
- ⚠️ **Pale/bleached top leaves** (light too close/intense)

### Use Visuals For:
- Pest detection
- Nutrient deficiencies
- Light stress
- Heat stress
- Growth tracking

### DON'T Use Visuals For:
- Deciding when to water (use sensor threshold!)

## Environmental Quick Checks

### Clone Phase (Days 1-14) - Current Status

**Humidity:**
- 🎯 Target: **70-75% RH**
- ✅ Good: 65-75%
- ⚠️ Low: 60-64% (turn on humidifier target 70%)
- ❌ Too Low: <60% (humidifier ON, intake fan OFF)

**Temperature:**
- 🎯 Target: **20-26°C (68-79°F)**
- ✅ Optimal: 25-26°C (best photosynthesis)
- ✅ Good: 20-24°C
- ⚠️ Cool: 18-19°C (acceptable, slower growth)
- ❌ Too Cold: <18°C (request human help)
- ❌ Too Hot: >28°C (turn on intake fan)

**VPD:**
- 🎯 Target: **0.4-0.8 kPa**
- ✅ Perfect: 0.4-0.8 kPa
- ✅ Acceptable: 0.3-0.9 kPa
- ⚠️ Slightly High: 0.9-1.0 kPa (monitor, not critical)

**CO2:**
- 🎯 Research Optimal: **1000 ppm** (increases photosynthesis)
- ✅ Good: 700-900 ppm (ambient)
- ⚠️ Low: <600 ppm (could improve with injection)

## When to Take Each Action

### Water Pump:
- ✅ Soil ≤40% (clone) OR ≤35% (veg) OR ≤30% (flower)
- ✅ Last watering >12 hours ago AND soil looks dry
- ❌ Soil >40% (clone) - don't water
- ❌ Watered <45 min ago - wait (pump safety)

### Humidifier:
- ✅ RH <65% during clone phase
- ✅ Set target=70% and let it auto-regulate
- ❌ RH >75% - turn OFF

### Intake Fan (lowers RH and temp):
- ✅ RH >80% (turn ON to reduce moisture)
- ✅ Temp >28°C (turn ON to cool down)
- ❌ Clone phase + RH 65-75% - keep OFF (preserve humidity)

### Camera/Photo:
- ✅ Every decision cycle (track visual progress)
- ✅ Before any watering (check saucer level!)
- ✅ When sensor reading seems questionable
- ✅ To verify plant health after actions

---

## Saucer Overflow Prevention

**Check saucer water level in EVERY photo:**

- ✅ Empty/dry → Normal, safe to water
- ⚠️ Quarter full → Monitor, reduce next watering
- ❌ Half full → Skip next watering, request human to drain
- ❌ Nearly overflowing → URGENT human help - drain NOW
- ❌ Overflowing → CRITICAL alert

**Why this matters:**
- Saucer overflow = flood damage
- Standing water = root rot
- Waste water runoff = environmental issue

## Research-Backed Facts (Trust These!)

### Temperature:
- **Warmer is better for photosynthesis:** 25-30°C optimal
- Cannabis acclimated to warm temps (32°C day) showed **higher photosynthesis** than cool (23°C)
- Current 23°C is good, 25-26°C would be even better

### CO2:
- **1000 ppm CO2 is research-proven optimal** (Bugbee 2021)
- Increases photosynthesis, especially at high light
- Ambient ~700 ppm is acceptable but suboptimal

### Air Movement:
- **"Constant airflow recommended to prevent diseases and mold"** (Chandra 2017)
- Research standard: 0.8 m/s at canopy
- **Keep circulation fan ON 24/7**

### Humidity for Clones:
- Research reports **75% RH for development stage**
- **Up to 90% RH used** for propagation (Hawley 2018)
- Gradually reduce to 55-60% after Day 10-14

## Harvest Timing (Trichome Color)

| Trichome Color | Meaning | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| **Clear/Translucent** | Immature | Not ready - keep flowering |
| **Cloudy/Milky (70-90%)** | **PEAK POTENCY** | **HARVEST NOW!** |
| **Cloudy (70%) + Amber (30%)** | Peak passing | Harvest ASAP |
| **Yellow trichomes** | Cannabinoids degrading | Harvested too late |
| **Brown/Black** | Senescent | Way too late - major degradation |

**CRITICAL:** CBD and THC can **DECLINE in final 2 weeks** of flowering!
Don't over-ripen! Harvest when mostly cloudy, before yellowing starts.

##When in Doubt:

1. **For watering:** Trust the sensor threshold
2. **For environment:** If plant looks healthy, conditions are working
3. **For catastrophes:** Reserve "CRITICAL" for actual emergencies (temp >95°F, severe wilting)
4. **For learning:** Reference your decision history - what worked before?
