## 📋 General Setup Steps (Most Tents)

### Step 1: Unbox and Inventory
- ✅ Check all parts are present (poles, fabric, connectors, zippers)
- ✅ Read any included instructions
- ✅ Clear a flat area for assembly

### Step 2: Assemble the Frame
1. **Connect the poles** - Usually they snap or slide together
2. **Form the base rectangle** - Connect 4 corner pieces
3. **Add vertical poles** - Stand up the corners
4. **Add top frame** - Connect horizontal bars at the top
5. **Check stability** - Frame should stand on its own

### Step 3: Install the Fabric
1. **Lay fabric flat** - Spread the tent fabric on the ground
2. **Slide frame into fabric** - Insert the assembled frame into the fabric sleeves
3. **Or attach clips** - Some tents use clips instead of sleeves
4. **Raise the tent** - Lift the frame to standing position
5. **Zip up doors** - Close all zippers to check fit

### Step 4: Install Accessories
1. **Ventilation ports** - Cut holes for exhaust/intake fans (if needed)
2. **Light hangers** - Install hanging bars or hooks for grow lights
3. **Power cord ports** - Cut holes for electrical cords (if needed)
4. **Observation windows** - Some tents have built-in windows

### Step 5: Final Setup
1. **Check zippers** - Ensure all doors open/close smoothly
2. **Test light leaks** - Close tent, turn off room lights, check for light coming through
3. **Install equipment** - Hang lights, install fans, place sensors
4. **Test ventilation** - Ensure air can flow properly

4. **Don't forget ventilation** - Need intake and exhaust
