## 🔄 CoinMarketCap Post-Submission

**Note:** CoinMarketCap has a similar but different process:

- They may ask for a **social media announcement**
- Format is similar but check their specific requirements
- Usually less strict than CoinGecko
- May not require ticket number in post

**For CMC, a simple announcement works:**
```
