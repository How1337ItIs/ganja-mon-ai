# Saga Lore AI – Documentation & Process Research

Quick look into whether the [Saga Lore AI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa4lcfIHwCV_Pyu8trzYARg) YouTube channel documents how they make their AI parody music videos (e.g. Star Trek, Harry Potter, Star Wars).

## TL;DR

**They do not document their process in public.** The only process-related hook found is on **Patreon** (“This Is My Process”-style content). Everything else is “coming soon,” links, or standard credits.

---

## What Exists

### Official site
- **https://sagaloreai.com/** – “Coming soon” + mailing list. No blog or docs. Links to:
  - YouTube, TikTok (@sagaloreai), Instagram (sagaloreai), Facebook, Spotify, Patreon, X (@Sagaloreai)
- Site is a Fourthwall storefront (merch/support), not a documentation hub.

### Patreon (only process lead)
- **https://www.patreon.com/SagaLoreAI**
- Tagline/subtitle from search: **“AI Generated Content - This Is My Proces”** (typo: “Process”).
- Suggests they explain their workflow there (likely paywalled). Page fetch timed out; worth opening in a browser.

### YouTube
- **Channel:** [@SagaLoreAI](https://www.youtube.com/@SagaLoreAI) (~106K subs).
- **Video descriptions** (e.g. [Harry Potter – Cowboy Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOtfMhLjeIk)):
  - Links to Instagram, Patreon, Spotify, Apple Music.
  - One line: *“This video is an AI-generated parody. No real people or minors are shown or referenced. All characters are fictional. Not intended for children.”*
  - No tool names, no “how we made this,” no BTS links.
- Other tracks (e.g. “The Cowboy Wizard” via DistroKid) use auto-generated DistroKid text only.
- **No tutorials or “how we do it” videos** found on the channel.

### Distribution / credits
- Music distributed via **DistroKid** (label: 8965646 Records).
- Credits on streaming (e.g. Shazam): “Saga Lore AI” / “Sagaloreai” as songwriter, producer, performer. No technical or tool credits.

### Other platforms
- **TikTok, Instagram, X** – Not crawled in depth; no public docs or process threads found in search.
- **Interviews/podcasts** – No interviews or podcasts found where they explain their pipeline.

---

## What Does *Not* Exist (as of this check)

- No public GitHub, Notion, or “how we make our videos” page.
- No tool credits in video descriptions (e.g. no mention of Suno, Udio, Kling, Runway, etc.).
- No public tutorials or BTS videos on their channel.
- No open “stack” or workflow doc.

## How to Get Their Process

1. **Patreon** – Most likely place: [patreon.com/SagaLoreAI](https://www.patreon.com/SagaLoreAI). Look for “This Is My Process” or similar posts (lowest tier was ~£3.50/mo in search).
2. **Mailing list** – [sagaloreai.com](https://sagaloreai.com/) signup; might announce when they publish process/docs.
3. **Ask them** – Comment on a video or DM on Instagram/TikTok/X asking if they’ve documented their pipeline or plan to.

## Unrelated “Saga” Things

- **writeonsaga.com** – Saga AI screenwriting/storyboarding app (scripts, storyboards, AI filmmaking). Not the same as Saga Lore AI the music channel.
- **saga.so** – Team workspace/notes product. Unrelated.
- **“Saga AI Filmmaking 101”** (YouTube) – Tutorial for the writeonsaga.com tool by a third party; not Saga Lore AI.
