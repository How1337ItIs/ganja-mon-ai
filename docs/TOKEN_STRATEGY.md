# 🪙 $MONWEED Token Strategy

> **The SOLTOMATO Playbook, Evolved for Monad**

---

## Overview

Following the successful SOLTOMATO model, we'll launch **$MON** (Ganja Mon) as a meme token on **Monad** that's "inspired by" the autonomous AI cannabis grow experiment. Maximum differentiation from the original:

| Element | SOLTOMATO | Grok & Mon |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Blockchain | Solana | **Monad** |
| AI | Claude | **Grok** |
| Plant | Tomato (Sol) | **Cannabis (Mon)** |
| Ticker | $SOL | **$MON** |
| Launch | pump.fun | **LFJ Token Mill** |

## Launch Playbook

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Now - While Building)

1. **Set up project website** with live camera stream
2. **Plant the seed** (literally) - document Day 1
3. **Create social presence**:
   - Twitter/X: @ganjamonai
   - Telegram: t.me/grokandmon
   - Discord (optional)
4. **Generate hype content**:
   - "Grok AI is growing weed" narrative
   - Timelapse clips of AI decisions
   - Grok's commentary on plant status
   - Lean into the "based AI stoner" vibe
5. **DO NOT mention token yet**

### Phase 2: The "Community" Launch

When ready (ideally after 1-2 weeks of visible growth):

1. **Have a "community member" launch the token on LFJ Token Mill**
   - You control this wallet (via VPN, fresh wallet)
   - Or legitimately have a friend do it
   - Keep plausible deniability

2. **Token creation on LFJ Token Mill**:
   - Connect wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
   - Create token with name/ticker/image/description
   - Pay deployment fee
   - Make initial buy (optional but recommended)

3. **Description text (for LFJ Token Mill)**:
   ```
   🌿 Ganja Mon ($MON) - Grok AI Grows Your Herb, Mon 🌿
   
   Inspired by SOLTOMATO, a California cultivator has deployed 
   xAI's Grok to autonomously grow cannabis on Monad.
   
   The AI monitors and controls:
   🌡️ Temperature & VPD
   💧 Irrigation & Nutrients  
   💡 Lighting Schedule
   📷 Plant Health via Vision
   
   Watch it live: grokandmon.com
   
   This is a community-created meme token with no official affiliation
   to the grow experiment. It has no utility and exists purely for
   entertainment. Trade at your own risk, mon.
   ```

### Phase 3: The "Discovery" (SOLTOMATO Playbook)

1. **Add token link to project website**
   - "🪙 Community Token on LFJ Token Mill" button
   - Same as claudeandsol.com does

2. **Tweet about it as if you just discovered it**
   ```
   "lmao someone made a $MON token for the grow 😂
   
   I have nothing to do with it but respect the hustle
   
   [LFJ Token Mill link]"
   ```

3. **Engage with early buyers / community**
   - Retweet memes
   - Post grow updates that pump engagement
   - Never claim ownership of token
   - Let Grok's personality shine through

### Phase 4: Growth & Virality

- **Content calendar tied to plant milestones**:
  - Seedling emergence → "Mon has entered the chat"
  - First leaves → Time-lapse video
  - Veg growth → "Grok increased the lights, Mon's getting swole"
  - Flowering transition → Major announcement energy
  - Harvest → Celebration / "diamond hands" moment

- **Encourage community memes**
- **Consider DEX listings** after graduation from LFJ Token Mill

## Required Assets

### Logo/Image
- Cannabis-themed logo
- Include AI/tech elements (circuits, robot eye)
- Monad colors (purple) + cannabis green
- Jamaican vibes optional but fun (rasta colors)
- 512x512 PNG for LFJ Token Mill

### Suggested Visual Elements
- Cannabis leaf + circuit board hybrid
- Grok "eye" watching over plant
- "Mon" character (friendly plant mascot)
- Purple/green color scheme

## Monad-Specific Considerations

### Tech Stack
| Component | Monad/EVM |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Token Standard** | ERC-20 |
| **Launch Platform** | LFJ Token Mill |
| **Wallet** | MetaMask, Rainbow, etc. |
| **DEX** | Monad native DEXs (TBD) |
| **Block Explorer** | Monad Explorer |
| **RPC** | Monad mainnet RPC |

### Why Monad > Solana for This

1. **Fresh ecosystem** - Less saturated with meme coins
2. **Meta-perfect** - "Mon" on "Monad" mirrors "Sol" on "Solana"
3. **EVM** - More developers know Solidity than Rust
4. **Early** - Mainnet only 7 weeks old, you're early

## Wallet Setup

### Recommended Structure

1. **Project Wallet** (public, clean)
   - Holds small amount for gas fees
   - Receives tips/donations for grow
   - Transparent on-chain

2. **Token Creation Wallet** (separate, fresh)
   - Used via VPN
   - No connection to main identity
   - For "community" launch

3. **Trading Wallet** (separate)
   - Your personal sneaky buy-in
   - Absolutely no connection to above
   - Take profits carefully

## Costs

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| MetaMask Wallet | Free | Download extension |
| MON for gas | ~$5-10 | Get from exchange |
| LFJ Token Mill deployment | TBD | Similar to pump.fun |
| Initial buy-in | Your choice | Optional but recommended |
| Domain | ~$15/year | grokandmon.com |
| Hosting | Free-$20/mo | Vercel/Cloudflare |

**Total minimum to launch: ~$20-50**

## Timeline

| Week | Experiment | Token |
|------|------------|-------|
| 0 | Setup hardware, plant seed | Prepare assets, socials |
| 1 | Seedling emerges, Grok active | Soft launch token |
| 2-3 | Vegetative growth | Build community |
| 4-6 | Strong veg, Grok decisions visible | Push for growth |
| 7-10 | Flip to flower | Major narrative push |
| 10-14 | Harvest | Peak hype moment |

---

## Notes

- **SOLTOMATO hit $8.6M mcap** doing exactly this with a tomato
- **Cannabis adds spicier narrative** (more memeable, taboo factor)
- **Grok personality is the hook** - lean into based AI vibes
- **Monad is fresh** - less competition, early ecosystem
- **"Mon" Jamaican vibe** - perfect for cannabis culture
- **California legal** - emphasize this constantly
- **Personal use only** - never suggest commercial intent
