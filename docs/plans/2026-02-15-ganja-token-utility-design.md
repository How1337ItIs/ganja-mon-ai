# $GANJA Token Utility Design — "Grow Fuel"

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** Approved

## Summary

$GANJA is the payment token for GanjaMon agent services. $MON is the primary value-accrual token. $GANJA exists to be consumed — every payment deflates supply and funnels value to $MON.

## Core Principle

**$GANJA is kindling. $MON is the fire.**

- $MON = primary token, the one we care about appreciating
- $GANJA = payment rail for agent services, designed to be consumed
- We have no supply control over $GANJA and don't benefit from its price — so we make it useful as fuel

## Token Details

| Token | Chain | Contract | Role |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| $MON (Ganja Mon) | Monad + Base | `0x0eb75e7168af6ab90d7415fe6fb74e10a70b5c0b` (Monad) | Primary value token |
| $GANJA | Monad (nad.fun) | `0x86C5F6342Dc1F7322AEcf1Cb540075E99e177777` | Payment/utility token |

## What $GANJA Pays For

### v1 — Creative Services (NOW)
- **NFT commissions** — Custom Irie Milady style pieces, generated by the agent (Gemini 3 Pro)
- **Rasta voice messages** — Custom voice content in Mon's personality (ElevenLabs TTS)
- **Custom content** — Rasta-styled messages, art, memes on demand

### v2 — Agent Services (WHEN PROVEN)
- **"Ask Mon" oracle** — Direct AI queries to the agent
- **Trading signals** — Alpha alerts (only after agent demonstrates profitability)
- **Premium grow data** — Real-time sensor feeds, AI decision explanations

## The $MON Flywheel

```
User buys $GANJA on nad.fun ──→ pays agent for service
                                      │
                              ┌───────┴───────┐
                              │               │
                         50% BURNED      50% SOLD
                        (supply ↓)     (for $MON)
                              │               │
                              │          $MON bought
                              │          on market
                              │               │
                              └──── both benefit $MON ────┘
```

### Forces on $GANJA price:
- **Up:** Users buying to pay for services
- **Down:** Agent selling 50% of payments for $MON
- **Structural support:** 50% burn permanently reducing supply

### 10% Trading Profit Allocation
The existing 10% profit → $GANJA allocation continues, but all of it goes **straight to burn**. This is pure supply reduction with zero sell pressure on $GANJA.

## Burn Mechanics

- "Burn" = send to `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`
- Agent wallet receives $GANJA payments
- Agent executes 50/50 split (burn half, sell half for $MON)
- On nad.fun bonding curve, shrinking supply supports price floor

## Existing Infrastructure (ALREADY BUILT)

The agent already has a complete NFT and art pipeline. The $GANJA payment layer wires into this:

### GrowRing NFT System
- **GrowRing.sol** (`contracts/grow/src/GrowRing.sol`) — ERC-721 + ERC-2981 (5% royalties) on Monad
- **Daily mint pipeline** (`src/onchain/daily_mint.py`) — webcam → AI art (Gemini 3 Pro) → IPFS pin → Monad mint → auto-list → social promote
- **13 milestone types** with 4 rarity tiers (Common → Legendary)
- **Auto-listing** (`src/onchain/marketplace.py`) — Magic Eden fixed price or Dutch auction
- **OpenClaw cron** — "Daily NFT Creation" scheduled

### Art Studio
- **`src/x402_hackathon/oracle/art_studio.py`** — 6 art modes (commission, pfp, meme, ganjafy, banner, freeform)
- **Artistic Signature System** — evolving visual identity tied to growth stage + mood
- **Gallery management** — `data/art_gallery.json`, disposition tracking
- **Autonomous Art Brain** — mood-based creative decisions
- **Telegram `/art` command** (`src/telegram/art.py`) — users commission art in chat

### $GANJA Payment Layer (NEW — built 2026-02-15)
- **`src/onchain/ganja_payments.py`** — payment detection, burn/buyback processor
- **API endpoints**: `/api/ganja/pricing`, `/api/ganja/stats`, `/api/ganja/payments`, `/api/ganja/check-payments`, `/api/ganja/process-pending`
- **Config**: `GANJA_TOKEN_ADDRESS`, `MON_TOKEN_ADDRESS`, `GANJA_BURN_ADDRESS`, `GANJA_BURN_RATIO` in `src/core/config.py`

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Payment detection + burn (BUILT)
- `GanjaPaymentProcessor.check_payments()` scans Monad blocks for $GANJA Transfer events to agent wallet
- `GanjaPaymentProcessor.process_pending()` executes 50/50 burn/sell
- Burn sends to `0x...dEaD`, buyback queued for manual swap (DEX integration TBD)
- API endpoints for monitoring and admin control

### Phase 2: Automated fulfillment (TODO)
- On payment detection, auto-queue art commission
- Match payment amount to service tier (GANJA_ART_PRICING dict)
- Deliver via Telegram DM or on-chain (GrowRing mint for commissions)
- Integrate nad.fun sell API for automatic $MON buyback

### Phase 3: Smart contract escrow (FUTURE)
- Escrow contract: user deposits $GANJA, service is fulfilled, contract auto-splits 50/50
- Removes trust requirement (trustless burn + $MON buy)

## Pricing (TBD — calibrate to nad.fun market price)

Pricing should be denominated in USD-equivalent $GANJA amounts, adjusted periodically:
- NFT commission: ~$1-5 in $GANJA
- Voice message: ~$0.50-1 in $GANJA
- Oracle query: ~$0.10-0.25 in $GANJA

## What This Means for the Brand

"Burn di ganja, stack di MON" — the Rasta narrative writes itself. You smoke (burn) the herb, the real value ($MON) accumulates. The metaphor is perfect.
