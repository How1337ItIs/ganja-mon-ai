# GanjaMon Agent Principles
# =========================
# Machine-readable constraints loaded at agent startup.
# Injected into AI system prompt as hard/soft guardrails.
#
# enforcement:
#   hard  — MUST be obeyed, violations are bugs
#   soft  — SHOULD be followed, exceptions OK with justification
#   info  — context for decision-making, not enforced
